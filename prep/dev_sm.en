Why did he run away?
Please let me try it again.
Twenty people died in a fire.
I thought you had to get up by 7:30.
Tom is going to make it on time.
We trust him.
Are you enjoying it?
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
I feel my age.
He has the habit of scratching his head.
If I were in her place, I wouldn't give up yet.
He's a smooth talker.
Why were you so slow?
The thieves made off with the jewels.
Tom ought to stop smoking.
The hostages will be released.
We thought it was hilarious.
Please correct my bill.
It's time to go home.
I don't want them to go away.
Why are you trying to make me laugh?
What is this nonsense?
I really don't want to do this.
My dream has come true.
How old are the kids?
He gets a haircut once a month.
I'm on my lunch break.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the intersection.
I don't remember, but I wish I did.
Tom is really motivated.
How long did you stay?
Put it on my bill.
The sky is clear.
Take a break.
The snow prevented us from arriving on time.
I figured you should know.
Do you know where my keys are?
You should do that soon.
He can't be smart if he can screw up something like that.
I can't say I'm terribly proud of what I did.
She was the first one to notice him.
She is out of danger.
Tom is constantly complaining.
You're depressed, aren't you?
She has no one to speak to.
We're doing everything we can for Tom.
You should not go alone.
When the curtain went up, the stage was dark.
Why don't you run for student council?
Who made the actual arrest?
We're on our way.
Tom's goal is to own a home before he's thirty.
Have you been drinking?
Snow reminds me of my hometown.
We hardly ever see you around here anymore.
Your bath is ready.
What's in front of you?
There are a lot of fish in that lake.
School begins at eight-thirty.
I'd like to help you reach your goals.
Where's the airport?
There's no way to know.
He walked toward the door.
We caught you.
I don't intend to help Tom do anything.
I used to be the same age as you.
I think you should lose some weight.
You idiot!
Why did you want to speak with us?
I worked hard to succeed.
Where did you go to school?
I feel like going out.
He does not need a wife to look after him.
Will you please shut the door?
Please show me the way to the station.
I thought I could trust you.
That's a strange question.
We can't begin the meeting until we have a quorum.
Wait here till he comes back.
He tried in vain to pull the wool over my eyes.
He has only a superficial knowledge of the subject.
I can't dance either.
Who owns this ship?
Try to do your best.
They didn't see anything.
May I offer you a drink?
This will not be tolerated.
It'll be all right.
It's for you to decide.
What do you think of the new teacher?
I'll teach you what you need to know.
I thought I heard you.
Any student can solve this problem.
They're not a threat.
How much did you bring?
She said nothing that would make him angry.
I don't anticipate a problem.
I sure hope he passes the test.
OK, I think I get it.
I could hear her sobbing in her bedroom.
The bird's wing was broken.
Thanks for your report.
My headache is finally gone.
I guess that's all I need.
How do you know which one is yours?
She is in her hotel now.
If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train.
Tom's funeral will be this weekend.
What do you think of this plan?
He dislikes me.
He left the door open.
Why does he become drowsy whenever he begins to study?
Tom started climbing.
Have you met him yet?
Tom was on time.
Tom didn't really understand.
I came back home late.
I'd better get back to my desk.
I think we need to be very careful not to hurt Tom's feelings.
I remember mentioning it once or twice.
I'll wait for you in my room.
They were plainly dressed.
I don't know what you call this.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
She looks very young.
I've been here all afternoon.
I lent Tom my camera.
Did you take it?
Tom returned to his office.
The wall was covered with pictures of gunshot victims.
He returned from Holland in June.
I've got blisters on my feet.
I just figured out what the problem is.
What are you doing tonight, Tom?
We criticized the photographer for not rescuing the child first.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
The arrow hit the target.
That's very personal.
Your daughter is not a child any more.
This is the boy who helped me.
Is anybody home?
I made that one.
I like cats very much.
You're clever.
You'll get into trouble.
May I call on you at your house tomorrow morning?
I don't know anything about the future.
No matter what you say, I don't think Tom is a nice guy.
He will arrive in Kyoto tomorrow.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
Tom and his wife have just had a baby.
It's not a conspiracy.
We thought that we wouldn't be able to stop Tom.
I want to do it for you.
We managed to get there on time.
I think Tom is a good coach.
We should spend our time creating content for our website rather than wasting time worrying about minor cosmetic details.
Your dreams will come true.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
We better be going.
She was cleaning the house in preparation for a party.
Thank you very much.
Tom asked Mary whether she'd like to go shopping.
That won't work!
The buildings look so tiny.
I didn't sleep at all last night.
Place it wherever you like.
If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me.
He thought up an excuse.
I like stories.
I'm easygoing.
It takes time.
They smell bad.
Why are you crying? It's just a movie!
A lot of soldiers were killed here.
It's not good to read in a dark room.
It is not known when he came up to London.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
I guess I could wait a little bit longer.
I must protest.
We weren't happy.
I hope you had a good time at the party.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
I was wrong.
I insist that we do this now.
I don't want to go outside this afternoon.
A man who never makes mistakes is a man who does nothing.
You're the only one I trust.
There's nothing nefarious going on here.
Do you plan to go abroad?
Don't let the fire die down.
It happened very fast.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
On hearing the news of the birth of his first child, he jumped for joy.
Everyone's saying it.
I should take this.
Do you know anyone here?
It is obvious that he is right.
There's not enough time.
The more you play, the better you'll get.
I'm sorry, I don't really remember.
Do you know how to whistle?
You're disloyal.
First of all, I must say this.
She was looking forward to going sailing with him.
I work for a travel agency.
After his wife died, he lived for quite a few more years.
That's not what I wanted to do.
She has nothing to do with that affair.
Well, I'm proud of you.
I was trying to reach you.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
I just think you should be careful, that's all.
What does this word mean?
I thought we were friends.
I still don't feel safe.
Organic food tastes better.
The income from this source is tax-free.
Let's start with the basics.
I wear shorts all the time.
That's logical.
I called Tom up.
Cats are smarter than you think.
Can you help me on this one?
She invited him in.
His house is across from mine.
You aren't invited.
Do you have to do this every time?
She's only interested in fish and cockroaches.
This guy deserves a medal.
You're taller than I am.
I only slept for three hours.
Her dream is to become a nurse.
I have many dreams.
Should I ask him out?
I don't remember his name.
This computer is yours, isn't it?
I need to be prepared.
What are you doing buying a house?
I'm thinking of learning Korean next semester.
She might have met him yesterday.
It's for you.
Will you do me a favor?
He is able to swim very fast.
It won't hurt.
Something is wrong with the engine.
Where have you been?
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
They're going to try.
It took courage to sail across the Pacific single-handed.
I can easily convince you of his innocence.
I have to try.
I'm the same height as Tom is.
The country declared war against its neighbor.
America's foreign debt shot past $500 billion.
She wants a new hat.
Where did the accident happen?
He whittled the stick to a sharp point with his hunting knife.
Pay attention to what he says.
I need some cash.
How old is that church?
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
Today is Thursday.
I don't know what it's like yet.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Fill the bottle with water.
I don't want to sleep.
What are you trying to prove?
I realized I wasn't ready.
Why don't you let me take a look?
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
That team has strong players.
You can do anything you want, depending on what floats your boat.
He doesn't like to lose.
I wake up at half past six in the morning.
I looked at myself in the mirror.
My life was in danger.
Why didn't you tell us that?
The street is full of cars.
Mom is washing the dog because he's dirty.
Please open it.
I returned Tom's book to him.
Turn on the lights.
It was nowhere to be seen.
That's just the way it is.
It's easy to fall into bad habits.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive.
That's a bad spot.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
I'm fed up with your constant complaining.
I really like this restaurant.
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
Isn't that where we first met?
A good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could in principle be disproved or falsified by observation.
I haven't tried doing it that way.
You found something they didn't.
Hand me the remote.
She will write another book one of these days.
He approached the door.
I'm dreading the exam.
We're sure of that.
Hurry up, or you will miss the train.
I have something very special planned for your birthday.
You might try that.
She must've been beautiful when she was young.
The prisoner was brought before a judge.
I can't ignore my commanding officer's orders.
I have a runny nose.
I think we're going to need more money.
The apple fell from the tree.
She is always dressed in black.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
Who's that boy swimming over there?
The grownups were talking among themselves.
When is your book coming out?
He's one of the best.
The airplane took off on time.
She became rich by virtue of hard work and good business sense.
What do you think of it?
Tom is a slow walker.
I suggest keeping your opinions to yourself from now on.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
You may have that opportunity.
I'm adding the finishing touches now.
I usually don't work here.
Have you ever seen Tokyo Tower?
The Normans conquered England in 1066.
I can't really describe it.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm happy with what I've got.
Let's start.
I know where you were yesterday evening.
Tell us a ghost story.
I'm not getting involved.
She attempted to kill herself.
Those are good.
Tom is in there alone.
You can't do anything right, can you?
Her reputation was hurt a lot by this.
The man finally confessed.
She advised him to work harder.
I wasn't expecting that to happen at all.
I visited her in Germany.
You may choose one of them.
It's 99.9% effective.
He fell ill because he ate too much.
It's for free.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
He drives a truck.
I don't have any money.
Could you get in touch with him?
Brush your teeth after every meal.
Could you turn off the lights?
He fell from the tree.
Would you like a taste?
I arrived on the night he left.
I'm saving money for a car.
I didn't want that.
Speak a little louder.
They let me go.
I can't really remember.
He insulted our team.
A committee is a group of people who individually can do nothing, but who, as a group, can meet and decide that nothing can be done.
It didn't go very well.
Let me explain this.
What were you doing when she came?
Tom has a migraine headache.
I don't have the slightest idea.
We can't trust anyone now.
Think it over and let me know what you decide.
Tom can't speak French without making a lot of mistakes.
We have a pool.
You are welcome here.
Everyone in the room checked their watches at the same time.
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
He is so careless that he often makes mistakes.
You are tired, aren't you?
People do that all the time.
I just wanted to look at you.
My father does play golf, but not well.
You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Tom took out his wallet to pay the bill.
I said it as a joke.
I've been asked to forward this message to you.
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
I'm studying economics at university.
I wish I could go with you today.
I just want you to know that I'm sorry.
The rope broke under the strain.
Your friends are late.
You can't be two places at once.
That's all it takes.
We're powerful.
We'll never forget your kindness.
Tom isn't ready to leave.
It could be a coincidence.
We're leaving in five minutes.
Excess of politeness is annoying.
I'm in the attic.
Tom went home at 6:30.
How do we know this isn't a trap?
I think we're safe for a while.
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
I don't even have a girlfriend.
My brother is eight years older than me.
Turtles hibernate.
The stock market is very active.
This is your bag, isn't it?
You have to memorize this sentence.
It's very big.
Who's your boyfriend?
I'm your friend.
You'll be asked why you want to be a teacher.
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him.
My daughter will come of age next year.
Don't interfere.
Go away.
I had a lot of fun last weekend.
Where did you find my umbrella?
I'm not that kind of girl.
Would someone please wake me up at 2:30?
Tom heard someone humming his favorite tune.
It's important that you understand.
The decision was easy to make.
He did it out of kindness.
Would you be friends with me?
He opened his mouth wide.
You gotta get more organized.
When did you first meet him?
Don't waste your money.
She opened the letter quickly.
We promised to stand by him in case of trouble.
I promise I'll call.
Would you like to go for a walk?
He is good at cooking.
Have you received a letter from him?
I'll text you the address.
Where do they come from?
In the summer I wear short-sleeved shirts.
Tom spilled some wine on his shirt.
Nobody has solved the problem.
I won't do that unless you want me to.
I'm reading the newspaper.
They're brave.
Thanks for all the fish.
Tom showed Mary something.
The provisions ran out after a short time.
I wonder if a human will ever be cloned.
Many American planes were shot down.
Is it raining now?
The British forces were ordered to seize the weapons.
Tom says he knows you.
I want you all to myself.
Hurry up. The train leaves in ten minutes. We don't want to miss it.
He's always worrying about his daughter.
Tom says he's been asked to give a speech.
My job search is really going rough. I don't have any connections.
I can't agree with you on that point.
I feel bad about what I said.
You are twice as strong as me.
This is the flag of Japan.
You're sneaky.
That was awesome.
I couldn't bring myself to tell her the truth.
You were late for work.
My mother makes cakes.
You're punctual.
Tom said he regretted not following Mary's advice.
Tom was really tired.
I think you should go to college.
I am curious.
She comes from a good family.
This was a gift from Tom.
Turn up the volume.
I doubt the new proposal will be accepted.
He has good reason to get very angry.
She is getting prettier and prettier.
Tom ran to the door and tried to open it.
He keeps all his savings in the bank.
I'm trying to talk to you.
He dwells in the country.
I know better than to be believe such a rumor.
That's all you get.
I'll mow the lawn tomorrow, unless it rains.
Do you think you can help Tom?
That's the right attitude.
At least try to come on time.
Young people tend to take things too far.
How many people are still down there?
Tom stood very close to Mary.
I like her dark eyes.
This is your fate.
How do I get out of this mess?
Let's never lose hope.
I took a shortcut.
That's very considerate of you.
There is a window on your left.
His weight strained the rope.
Do you like music?
I made a fortune.
Please tell me what this means.
Whatever he may say, I won't change my mind.
I looked up the words in my dictionary.
Let's see.
No sailboat is faster than this one.
I'll just get you started.
I hate the world because the world hates me.
The lake supplies the city with water.
I thought I'd lost you.
I'm sorry about the way I acted last night.
Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
The plans for the offensive were secret.
I needed to be sure he'd come here.
What do you seek?
We had a rest in the shade.
I'm aware of what is at stake here.
I can do more than just cook.
He's not allowed to leave the country.
This law applies to everybody.
When did you go to work?
He can hardly speak.
Tie your shoe.
Guess who won.
The door opened and there she was, standing in the doorway.
I didn't run away from home.
You look strong.
Don't bother getting up.
I'd like to work at a hospital.
Tom gets angry very easily.
They had no alternative but to retreat.
I'm not sure about it.
He was petting the dog.
Tell me how I can help you.
Tom actually figured it out by himself.
I will try again.
Be there tonight.
Let's go back the way we came.
I just got promoted.
You don't seem very concerned.
That was really intense.
Tom said that Mary died in her sleep.
All our teachers were young and loved teaching.
What has become of him?
If you don't want to give a speech, you don't have to.
Was Tom the one who brought this?
That's not your knife.
It is too hot.
I don't regret what happened last night.
I know sign language.
That room is not very large.
As it is, prices are going up every week.
I need more money.
Let me try something.
They released the prisoner.
You're not bruised.
I went straight to bed.
Is there anything else to eat?
The neighbors called the police.
She broke the window on purpose.
He hoped to succeed.
Are you already married?
The roses in my garden are beautiful.
He is a very careful driver.
It's fall now.
I want you to call off the fight.
The weather outlook for tomorrow is not good.
What's it going to be?
I take it back.
Do you get it?
He collected various information.
You'll have a hard time.
The difference between the right word and almost the right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.
We must fix this.
Explain the fact as clearly as possible.
He is what is called a man of action.
It's all nonsense.
What's the name of the mountain range?
We can't just leave Tom here by himself.
It was very ugly.
There is an urgent need for water.
I especially want to thank our record-breaking sales team.
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
Tom told Mary to keep that a secret.
Tom is a real estate agent.
I don't think anyone noticed what we did.
Where did you go?
You should be proud of yourselves.
The epidemic has been contained.
I must apologize.
Do you need an ambulance?
You don't need a list.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
The problem should be solved.
The only language Tom can speak is French.
Are you sure they can do this?
Have you read this article?
He pretended not to hear me.
He went traveling in search of adventure.
He couldn't help laughing at it.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
Did you just call me a monkey?
I know where she lives.
I don't think this is for you.
What is all this stuff?
Eating too much is bad for your health.
They don't speak Spanish.
Everyone is friendly to her.
Are you seriously thinking about starting your own business?
You have done very well.
Shouldn't you be in school?
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
We adopted an alternative method.
You're a very attractive woman.
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
Did you find Tom?
The painter died young.
People can easily tell the difference between them.
She went on with the work.
Don't speak so fast.
All their efforts were in vain.
He's intimidated by beautiful women.
It's really awesome.
You're always anticipating trouble.
May I come in?
I've come a long way to see you.
Take mine.
I don't want them to go away.
A car went by.
I have enough money to buy it.
Do you study any foreign language?
We want our money.
Open your book to page nine.
You lucky devil!
He looked pretty tired.
I shouldn't have to say anything.
I can't wait any more.
This oil painting dates from the 17th century.
If something is wrong, tell me.
Bigger is not always better.
I need to be alone for a while.
Whose phone is this?
Tom has done other stupid things.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
I didn't mean any of it.
She stayed up late to finish sewing your dress.
Did she sleep well?
How come you know all this?
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
You can't learn that in school.
I saw him go into the toilet a few minutes ago.
Are you crazy?
I usually have a light breakfast.
Is there any other way besides extraction?
I didn't suspect anything.
You're not helping.
They will survive.
I have no further questions.
Don't let her go out after dark.
There weren't any roses in the garden.
A lot of people do that.
He lives as if he were a millionaire.
Getting married is a serious matter.
That's one of ours.
Don't worry about that now.
Three years ago today, Tom and I got married.
He met a nice young man.
I love doing this.
I haven't seen him in a few days.
We didn't intend to attack him.
I have a pretty dog.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
Translating this sentence will be very easy.
Don't let me down.
Would you teach me?
Where would you like to go?
Will you accompany me?
Adopting a low calorie diet will increase your lifespan.
Tom was excited, too.
She threatened to set our house on fire.
You've got a visitor.
That's what I saw.
The goods arrived yesterday.
It's just a matter of time.
I can see that now.
That'll put you in danger.
You know we'd never hurt you.
You recognize him, don't you?
The tornado left a trail of destruction in its wake.
All of us have some interest in history. In a sense, we are all historians.
Don't be such a jerk.
I basically like your plan.
I'll take those.
I'm all packed and ready to go.
Your examination results are excellent.
We must succeed.
I just couldn't let that happen.
May I have the check, please?
I'm a married woman now.
Did you hear the roar of the lions?
I'd like to have a little talk with you.
If he finds out, certainly he will be very angry.
Tom is drowning!
We're going to do everything we can.
We're a team.
You can start anytime.
If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car.
I looked around and noticed that mine was the only car on the road.
Let's sing some English songs together.
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
He acts like a rock star.
We haven't found it.
Do you think I look like my brother?
Tom knows what he's talking about.
He muttered something under his breath.
May I see your invitation please?
He asked his father to take him to the store.
Didn't you lock up your car?
What do you think of these shoes?
She left here right away.
I'm surprised it was that easy.
That changes nothing.
I can't pay the rent.
Some of the girls laughed.
Do you want to go out tonight?
Tom is always playing video games.
There's no film in this camera.
Both of them started laughing.
I ran away from home when I was thirteen.
We can't leave our tents on the beach where they are now. If we do, they'll be under water during high tide.
You are so cute.
Don't make fun of me.
I hope you find it interesting.
Is this your wine?
It was his wish to go to Paris.
Did he say that?
Have you made your decision yet?
It is getting warmer day by day.
He entered junior high school.
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
Did you think about our offer?
She was the first one to help him.
Will he come to the meeting next week?
I figured that would make you laugh.
He has a bicycle.
I know you love me.
How do you feel at this moment?
There's a secret passage.
There's no more time.
Nobody can control us.
I haven't the foggiest idea.
I'm going out for a drink.
I think I'm a pretty good singer.
Nothing happened.
The church is between my house and yours.
Do you know who he is?
Who are you?
Their muscles are stiff.
You're not being very supportive.
I was very tired.
I want to know who called.
You look good in a kimono.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
What did you get for Christmas?
I hate fighting.
They're really ugly.
He betrayed you.
Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814.
She saw me enter the store.
What's in front of you?
It's all wet.
I'm not in the mood right now.
I learned that when I was in high school.
You're scaring the kids.
I have enough money to buy it.
The ice is very thick.
If you would like to have further information, please contact me.
I can show you a better time.
She is looking for a job where she can make use of her foreign language ability.
Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that something like this would happen.
You've got nothing.
The statue of Hachiko, the faithful dog, stands in front of Shibuya Station.
Can you explain what PKO stands for?
I do like the way you think.
How long have you been teaching English?
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
How late do you stay open?
He paid a visit to his friend.
I stepped aside so that he could come in.
Declarations of variables are extremely important in C and C++.
He gave some milk to the cat.
They're probably Americans.
That looks like tea.
She recognized him immediately.
He was curious about how it would taste, so he took a small bite.
We got behind the car and pushed.
They want a few more hours to finish the report.
You should find a more constructive way of venting your anger.
How much time did you spend doing research before you started writing?
I didn't think you'd be coming.
Let's leave her alone.
I haven't said yes yet.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
She has no brothers.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
It doesn't fit well here.
Some voters waited hours to vote.
He loves singing.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
You're just like your father.
I think Tom is smarter than that.
My boss has the ability to read books very fast.
It's his first day at school.
I forgot all about it.
I guess what I've said isn't all that clear, but that's the only way I can explain it.
Open the door, please.
I always have two cups of coffee in the morning.
He said, "I want to be a scientist."
Tom's dog hates cats.
What is your ultimate goal in your life?
Please let me introduce myself.
They were cousins.
Stop worrying about that.
I want to apologize for the other day.
The painting is not worth the price you are asking.
I'm usually not this busy.
Never forget to lock the door.
For the past 10 years, I've fed my dog dry dog food.
Doing that would be a mistake.
What are you doing here?
Is the dog swimming?
I have to tell him something.
Don't tell me what I know.
Everybody started to leave.
Moses came down from the mountain bearing divine commandments.
I don't have any books to read.

Could I borrow your eyeliner?
He helped the lady into the car.
When are you going back to your own country?
She is a reliable person.
I think you're cute.
Are you trying to kill me?
I get up at six almost every day.
You can't keep doing this to yourself.
I like this one.
I didn't have the sense to do so.
Tom can't speak French.
Stay awake.
Don't ask questions, just come with me.
My wife is always finding fault with me.
Get to the point.
They knew how much danger they were in.
He's gone into hiding.
I'm wondering whether to take on that job.
I'm giving it back.
Please stop laughing.
Let's start with the why.
She abandoned her children.
I'm in a desperate situation.
Are you following me?
That's why I did it.
Many people think I'm crazy.
I want you to get in your car.
Don't touch this!
I think you're wrong.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
I had a little help.
I will survive.
I need to see you in my office.
He was expelled from school.
I caught a cold last month.
Everybody loves a winner.
No problem.
Every little boy needs a hero.
Did they tell you why you had to do this?
Tom must be wrong.
No one knows what to say.
New Year's cards provide us with the opportunity to hear from friends and relatives.
The milk went sour.
She never told me.
You should get your eyes checked.
Her daughter is a nurse.

I take a bath every day.
We had fun with them.
We fixed the price at $15.

Have you got any ideas yet?
The audience could hardly wait for the concert to begin.
He is tall and strong.
Dad's always encouraging him.
We were surprised at his conduct.
Tom has serious health problems.
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour.
Who gave the command?
I'm a pretty good student.
We didn't think of that.
I thought I heard you.
I wonder whose these scissors are.
We're going to keep doing this until someone tells us that we can't.
You've got a pretty good memory.
He has the ability to do the work.
I wanted you to keep that.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
What happened exactly?
He gathered his books together.
I'm looking into getting one.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I was the only man.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
I didn't ask you to come with us.
Nobody tells the truth anymore.
Get in the car.
May I have a piece of it?
They said he was still weak from a recent sickness.
Pencils are sold by the dozen.
I've been watching you study.
Are you the group leader?
It doesn't matter.
I want to see that movie again.
He whistled for his dog.
Have a nice weekend!
I bet you're right.
She visits us every other day.
She fainted, but came to after a few minutes.
I love jokes.
Half the office took a day off.
My house faces the sea.
Tom bought Mary many gifts.
He is the head of marketing.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
Please prepare for the trip.
She told him that she was sad.
This is typical.
Such incidents are quite common.
What you are saying does not make sense.
I know that name.
I'm married now.
She is proud of her daughter.
Hurry up, or you will miss the train.
I heard voices.
She kept on working.
You're winning.
I've got a meeting at 2:30.
I returned to my hometown after five years' absence.
Do I look OK?
How could you be so cruel?
Tom's birthday was yesterday.
I will have finished the work before you return.
I want you to get a good night's rest.
I don't care about your past.
He was checking you out.
I think that's too expensive.
I don't want to tell Tom.
Turn off the radio, please.
The ice is not thick enough to hold our weight.
I can't help but feel partly responsible.
Show him how to do this.
Do you like rap?
We have to tell them something.
May I use your telephone?
No charges have been filed.
It cost me 10 dollars.
Do you like oysters?
The crow spread his wings.
You're so impatient.
She's neither rich nor famous.
We're friends, right?
She accompanied me on the piano.
Tom is smoking on the balcony.
Didn't I mention that?
I was frightened.
I never think about it.
That old book is a real find.
My painting is starting to look pretty cool.
I think it's time for me to ask for directions.
I ran as fast as I could.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
At last, we got the information.
They got it.
Why would somebody want to live there?
All the members of the committee hate one another.
What'll you give me for this?
The addict died from a drug overdose.
Tom is a little nervous.
Her only wish was to see her son one last time.
What we're doing is dangerous.
She tossed me grapes and I tried to catch them with my mouth.
He wanted the cab driver to turn left.
I was at a job interview.
It is time to go to bed.
I get arrested from time to time.
Do you have a place to stay tonight?
They were naive.
You have put your hat on backwards.
You don't have to lie.
What an interesting book this is!
I remember that vividly.
Don't stand in my way.
I really need to go home and catch some zees.
Don't let it get to you.
That was then and this is now.
The boy almost drowned.
That cut on your arm looks pretty serious.
This bridge is built of stone.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
They're up to no good.
Water conducts electricity.
It took me three days to clean the room.
No one knew who owned the land.
Which do you usually drink, wine or beer?
Thank you for doing that for me.
I glanced through the brochure.
Your time is over.
Tom warned you.
Tell me you still love me.
Tom has a weak stomach.
He will be coming to the party.
I kid you not.
He lays on his back.
The cows are eating grass.
I've been impressed with Tom's work.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
I couldn't take your place.
You'll feel better if you take this medicine.
I understand this.
How did you know Tom would help?
I was present at school yesterday.
It seems quiet enough.
You should look out for potholes when driving.
It depends on how much money you have.
I met Tom at the library.
You should rewrite this sentence.
I had some fun.
I don't know how old I am.
None of us had any idea what was going to happen.
Don't tell anybody.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
You shouldn't eat any fish that come from this river.
For my part, I have no objection.
No one is listening to me.
I met him quite unexpectedly.
She is always buying expensive clothes.
She told him her age.
Stop sending me flowers.
I still owe my brother the ten dollars that he lent me last week.
So, how did he like it?
He decided to put off his departure.
Do you mind if I don't do this?
Who wrote the letter?
Have you spoken to Tom?
Eat your soup while it is hot.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
Tom just returned from Boston.
It's getting larger.
I picked you some flowers.
I cannot look at this picture without thinking of my dead mother.
I'll take you there.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
None of us plan to go swimming today.
I think we're going to be OK.
Don't phone me while I'm at the office.
Everybody likes you.
Shut the door.
I actually had fun tonight.
He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him.
Do you have any aspirin on you?
You're the one who trained me.
I understand your concern.
Forget about her.
Which book is yours?
It's about time for dinner.
I was amazed at the fluency with which the boy spoke French.
That company produces microchips.
Be sure to drop in on us if you come our way.
Are you drinking?
She'll get the better of you if you aren't careful.
We want you to be the team captain.
It's all right.
I took control of the situation.
She gave us some useful information.
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble.
You may go in now.
It occurred to him that he should start at once.
You've got some nerve.
Tom doesn't have either a cat or a dog.
I don't trust anyone.
Are you up?
Tom and Mary don't like the same kind of food.
We just have to be patient.
All I want is your love.
My mother gets up the earliest every morning.
I assure you I'm in perfect health.
Could you read this for me?
Will you still be here when I get back?
I can't carry on like this.
I think Tom wants to see you.
My mother set the table for dinner.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I also gave him a little something as a Christmas present the other day.
I'm excited.
Is that all right with you?
Come whenever you want to.
A pair of earrings is a nice present for her.
It's one of those moments.
I hear you were grounded.
He's a movie buff.
The dog barked.
She used to help him with his homework.
I have your schedule here.
Tom heard some shots.
Be proud of yourself.
You must find work.
People who will lie for you, will lie to you.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
Is this seat free?
Learn these names by heart.
Tom laughed at some of Mary's jokes, but he thought some of them weren't very funny.
Keep singing.
I'm sorry I said that.
I hate this carpet.
Did it make you angry?
They can't hear you.
You can do whatever you want now.
I feel their pain.
Tell me what really happened.
My father works hard because he wants to give us everything we need.
I remember your father.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
Be watchful.
Tell me what really happened.
Are you in Paris?
You must learn from your own mistakes.
My father is at home.
Think it over and let me know what you decide.
We found it here.
Let's get off the bus.
No one could see us.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
You can't do it, can you?
I think I've forgotten something.
We have refused.
Most of my friends are guys.
Tom appeared to be in his early thirties.
Let's hit the road.
Call me anytime.
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry.
Which of you will come with me?
"How are you doing?" "I'm doing okay."
Would you like to switch seats?
Tom is a spy.
He cares about no one, but himself.
This is strictly forbidden.
I like to be spontaneous.
She earns a living as a writer.
I just need to be alone.
I'm willing to help you if you want me to.
That was totally my fault.
He's gone into hiding.
I hurried and managed to catch the bus.
I love old prewar gangster movies.
Give me some coffee if there is any left.
That meant no.
When I was a boy, I always got up early.
Do you want some of these fries?
We should help.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
That's all I remember.
The pressure is getting to him.
What relieves the pain?
She was dressed in red.
You should wash fruit before you eat it.
You have to do as I say.
I recommend a thorough checkup for your husband.
Don't beat yourself up.
I'm furious.
I want to buy a more expensive watch.
Night is when most people sleep.
My hobby is collecting coins.
I work too much.
This book is way more interesting than that one.
We've got company.
Search everyone who comes into this room.
I think it's time for me to buy a decent car.
I have fond memories of all the time we spent together.
They have us out-gunned, but we'll have the element of surprise.
They made me go there.
Tom never knew Mary was rich.
Are you real sure about that?
Do you want some company?
I do not drink coffee.
Were you looking at her legs?
He's sitting in the waiting room.
How long have you been doing this?
Classes start at eight in the morning.
Was there a note?
Tom claimed to be Mary's son.
He knows how to cheat people.
It's made of leather.
The big, yellow bus came hurtling down the street.
We arrived at the office on time.
Do you understand what I am saying?
It's a great night to go dancing.
They have nothing in common.
I just want to be left alone for a while.
I don't even know who has stolen what.
I hate to eat alone.
They found him guilty.
She came up with a good way of making money by using the Internet.
He arrived very early this morning.
I bought a book yesterday.
He left his son a fortune.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
The old man gave her a small doll.
Look at the blackboard, everyone.
Let me introduce my mother to you.
If you want a pencil, I'll lend you one.
I hate moving.
Oh, didn't I mention it?
My daughter's getting all gussied up for her first date.
He is able to play the guitar.
Tom used to bake us cookies.
We have to find another way to do that.
How do you spell your last name?
I don't understand what Tom told us.
I promise you I'll keep you safe.
This is not natural.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
I'm going to church.
I'm not rich enough to buy that.
Tom has very short hair.
I'm a very lucky man.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I'm certain that I'll win the tennis match.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Get me out of here.
Suddenly, my mother started singing.
I don't have your strength.
He'll be along in ten minutes.
If you do not have this book, you can buy it.
I have no intention of meddling in your affairs.
We went on a picnic together.
Can you hold on a little longer?
He's the most popular boy in the class.
I don't feel like getting up.
You know the drill.
I've been alone for a long time.
That would be interesting.
The answer was discouraging.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
Why would I be mad?
Is it blue?
I have my own theory.
I have enough money to buy it.
Tom parked the car behind Mary's house.
Am I that transparent?
I'll see you at nine tomorrow morning.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Before deciding, I would like to consult with my family.
I hope you're well rested.
You should look that word up.
Her beauty was beyond description.
You're upset.
Tom didn't get home till midnight.
The problem is worse.
The three were arrested.
Don't act surprised.
She told her children to put away their toys.
Words cannot describe it.
It looks like she's got a lot of friends.
You're too suspicious about everything.
He let the dog loose in the garden.
I continued singing.
Tom can't do this alone.
Why don't you go on a diet?
I fear for the future of mankind.
He'll be back in two hours. In the meantime, let's prepare dinner.
Where were you all night?
I met him on the previous day.
I'm sure Tom did his best.
You should exercise.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
She understands him.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
The town has many tall buildings.
He killed himself by taking poison.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
Let's go by car.
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
I don't expect you to be my friend.
That boy looks like you.
I feel sorry for you.
You're overreacting.
You've got no alibi for the day of the murder.
I let them go.
This is your fault.
I hope you two are very happy.
You're planning something, aren't you?
Can you see that small house?
She makes a good living.
Tom wants to move to Boston.
You get out only what you put in.
Don't ask me that again.
Let's play volleyball.
I can't remember all their names.
We're not leaving.
He is depressed.
He's three years older than her.
I don't care what you think.
If you follow me, I'll show you the way to the hospital.
Tom wanted to talk about something else.
I was born in Osaka in 1977.
I did nothing of the sort.
I had a lot of fun.
Thanks to you, I have problems with my blood pressure.
All the villagers went out into the hills to look for a missing cat.
Some of my best friends are policemen.
Maybe that's the reason.
I need to stop.
I can't tell you the truth.
Whatever happened to your pride?
I remember everything you tell me.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
I had no control over the situation.
A moral person doesn't lie, cheat, or steal.
Am I interrupting anything?
You are always complaining.
That isn't much, is it?
I figured I'd be safe here.
This is how I did it.
The cloth was dyed bright red.
What will happen to her?
That reminds me of home.
Riding a unicycle is one thing I'm not very good at.
I want ten plates.
Whenever I try to get near her, she pushes me away.
He has a point.
You can't make us stop.
Helen Keller was blind, deaf and mute.
Playing Russian roulette isn't really a good idea.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
He made good use of the money.
Tom helped his son get dressed.
Some people do not like to wake up early in the morning.
I have an identical twin.
No one was injured.
It seems that I have lost my keys.
He helped me move.
Things happen for a reason, right?
She left her ticket at home.
Honesty pays in the long run.
That's nonsense.
I will not see him any more.
Don't be afraid.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
Of course!
I ran to school, but the bell had already rung.
Did you ask Tom why?
He is old enough to understand it.
My father is suffering from influenza.
You're very curious.
My father bought me a digital watch for birthday present.
I’ve started learning Esperanto.
We need to take this into account.
The price of oil is down this week.
I'd like to sing you a song.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
When did that happen?
Don't call me anymore.
Tom is talking.
Let me do this for you.
We all strive for success.
I don't know what you heard about me.
I think we'd better get out of here.
Are you doing anything special for New Year's Eve?
He went to France to brush up on his speaking ability.
Where was Tom born?
What were we supposed to do?
That's the danger.
You're very lonely.
Why are you so hard-headed?
It's a hassle trying to decide what to wear to the party.
I found the key underneath the mat.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I think I've persuaded Tom to donate some money.
Who are you there with?
I was bored.
Do you want me to be your bodyguard?
Right now, I feel like talking.
Tom is back in town.
I think it's time to leave.
She spent most of her senior year in high school strung out on drugs.
Last night's game was exciting.
If Tom needs help, we can give it to him.
Is he sleeping?
We were all alone.
She got married in her teens.
There are many bridges in this city.
Apart from on rainy days, I always ride my bike to work.
Tom realized he was alone.
We can win.
He had fun with it.
I turned on the lights.
Who else do you miss?
Don't forget to mail the letter.
There's no chance you're getting away.
They're now alone.
Can you keep it a secret?
They've lost so much.
I should've changed the oil.
You're very curious.
Stop being so naive.
I'm tired of being careful.
No one seems to smile anymore.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
Could you just turn around for a second?
He arrived on time in spite of the rain.
I'll take two or three days off.
What do you know about him?
Did you open all the boxes?
I've given up on the idea of buying a house.
Congratulations!
Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on March 17th.
There's a restaurant pretty close to here, but it's not very good.
He turned his attention to the picture.
This cloth is really smooth and silky.
Let me explain the rules.
They already know.
Who knows what could happen?
I was horrified.
I'd like to talk to Tom myself.
I thought it was funny.
My shoes are the same size as his.
It's not as easy as people think.
Look at her putting on airs over there.
I don't know why we're so busy.
My hobby is taking pictures of wild flowers.
The radio is too loud. Turn the volume down.
When will you leave?
Look at the picture.
I had to get away from here.
He is proud of being a musician.
Meet me at the hotel bar.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
I got up earlier than usual to catch the first train.
Do you think I can use my cellphone in the shower?
It is necessary to have a license to drive a car.
Aren't you going to report it?
I have an appointment this morning.
It seems that you are not having a good time here.
The old man spent most of his time looking back on his youth.
A frog in a well doesn't know the ocean.
That's fine with me.
Will he live?
It'll probably rain.
Look on both sides of the shield.
I'll make some coffee.
Tom didn't have time to read the report.
I have two brothers.
I'm not ashamed of my father being poor.
People say that Japan is the richest country in the world.
Will you light the fire?
Come along with us.
Could you come and see me tomorrow?
He has been playing chess since he was in high school.
She likes jazz, and I do, too.
I am glad to hear the news.
We got up at dawn.
Close the door, please.
You shouldn't let people use you like that.
I just want to know how far we're going.
Was there a fire?
How much did you pay for the dress?
We have a lot of time.
I eat a lot of carrots.
There were a lot of young couples in the park.
They seem surprised.
I've got to speak to you.
"Thanks for the help." "Don't mention it."
Who are you going with?
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
You don't understand women, Tom.
One student was arrested.
It's an old custom.
This is your fault.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
She had twins.
I bought the book for ten dollars.
He is amusing himself by playing video games.
This is an ancient law.
That's how the pros do it.
She tried to conceal her grief at the party.
I have to change into my work clothes.
We have not yet begun to fight.
Will you ever forgive me?
That's already been done.
Until that day, I had never eaten dog meat.
There is no way of reaching the island other than by boat.
Let's stop talking and start working.
I appreciate the invitation.
Which wine goes best with red meat?
I want to think for myself.
I just didn't want you in here.
What else can you tell us?
I like to study English.
Was that not clear?
Was it you that left the door open last night?
Tom had better hurry or he'll miss the bus.
I want to get married and have children.
I'm not sure this is necessary.
I can swim very fast.
I still need to talk to you.
Will it rain this afternoon?
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
He's reading a novel right now.
This is big news.
I'd heard you'd changed.
You're a very gifted artist.
I want you to go to your room and lock the door.
Look out for pickpockets on crowded trains.
I have been busy.
I've got plenty of time.
If you want, you can phone me.
Bring me my hat.
Tom wants to know which of the books is the most interesting.
Her son was killed in a traffic accident.
She started crying.
Don't call me a jerk.
He tricked me.
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow.
Is there something in particular that you want to know?
I own a horse.
You're young.
We'll be late for class.
I feel a lot better.
I cannot read French.
I suddenly realized that my watch was gone.
Go and speak to my colleague.
He has seen better days.
You're resilient.
Why don't we take the subway?
I'm sorry for what I have done.
If you eat at this time of night, you'll get fat.
She wore a beautiful dress.
Don't you hear what I'm saying?
This is great.
He'll become a good husband.
I will ask him where he went last Sunday.
Has Tom noticed yet?
She wasn't polite to him.
He's a Republican fundraiser.
He had no objection.
I got here a little early today.
Tom is recovering from his injuries.
I fell for it.
I wasn't involved.
He got tired of reading.
You should stretch properly before exercising.
Our teacher sometimes speaks too fast.
This textbook is written in simple English.
I feel kind of nauseous.
You are too young to travel alone.
It all started on a hot summer night.
Let's speak in French.
I wonder who they are.
Who is the manager?
Apparently, the bus is late.
I think we should talk about this now.
You can always text Tom.
Don't cheat.
Why are we still fighting?
This airplane is capable of carrying 40 passengers at a time.
I cut classes.
I think Tom only speaks French.
He became a pianist.
He came to school even though he was unwell.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
I took her for an American.
I shouldn't have asked you that.
We need our demands to be met.
She has a 10 percent interest in the company.
You're not listening!
Tom started packing his suitcase.
Would it be possible for me to get something to drink?
I really had a good time today.
We are looking for someone who is proficient in French.
It's all about money.
You can't do both at the same time.
Do you think I'm fat?
Mary took her necklace off.
Zoos are like prisons for animals.
She teaches reading and writing.
My father doesn't drink so much sake.
She got to the hotel late at night.
She had the box carried to the first floor.
Where did you meet your boyfriend?
Why do you want to do that anyway?
We have the whole summer to play.
I was hurt by many people.
Tom decided to cooperate.
It's very beautiful.
I think you might need my help.
Could you type this letter for me?
I returned the books I borrowed from the library, and I borrowed some new ones.
I don't know all of them.
We hit it off right off the bat.
He usually went to bed at eleven.
The police accused him.
The box is almost empty.

Please don't make me eat that.
I had no work yesterday.
As a last resort, read the instructions.
I can't believe it's really you.
Is this going to work?
These shoes are so tight that I can't put them on.
I bolted the door.
You can use my bicycle.
Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.
Can you call him?
How can you fix it?
You don't have the nerve.
You deserve a prize.
When was this church built?
I love the way you kiss.
What do you think of when you look at this photo?
The Zulu tribe in South Africa has its own language.
They had a spat yesterday.
Who made this box?
My brother is ambidextrous.
The fuel tank in the car is full.
Do you drink beer?
I love seeing you so happy.
It's tax season.
He cured my illness.
You've got the wrong person.
I'm glad that you understand.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Tom will be back home soon.
I lied to you the other night.
There was no warning.
No matter what happens, don't give up.
When did you start dating?
They are a peace-loving people.
A burglar broke into my house while I was away on a trip.
Please do whatever you think is necessary.
Can you take a little break?
Would you like to have lunch with me?
I appreciate your telling me this face-to-face.
They gave up.
I've been trying to lose a little weight.
I'm getting off the train at the next station.
Everybody cheered.
How did last night go?
Turn on the air conditioner.
Your shoes are wet. Put them near the fire.
The answer was staring me in the face.
If I could stay longer, I would.
It would be a pity to let all our hard work go to waste.
I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
Take it, or leave it.
She waved both her hands so that he could find her.
Do you know what this is all about?
He applies this principle to everything in life.
It's time for you to buy a new car.
They'll be fine.
We're ruthless.
The doctor continued to observe the patient's behavior.
I want to go there once more.
Go away right now!
Keep where I can see you.
There were all sorts of group activities.
Tom has joined the army.
He asked me what I needed.
Because her parents got divorced, the girl had hardly any contact with her father.
Which is your target?
When was Tom fired?
It was where Tom said it would be.
This room is very warm.
How dare you accuse me of that!
I totally freaked out.
I go to the library at least once a week.
This is the most comfortable chair in our house.
We talked about it all night.
I know I'm alone on this.
We're not impressed.
The workers were naked to the waist.
Could I get one more beer, please?
The windows were open.
Mary brought her daughter to work.
I promise I'll bring it right back.
Do you expect me to believe you?
When you have a question, ask the teacher.
When I was a child, I used to go to the seashore every summer.
Where are the others?
My friend helped me.
Is this your girlfriend?
I don't know where you work.
Can you drive me home?
I thought you'd be dead by now.
Anyone hurt?
Lunch is on.
Tell her that I love her.
His cottage is on the coast.
We're dealing with it.
Have you ever eaten anything that made you hallucinate?
I didn't think you'd come back.
We like to talk.
Tell me where you went.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
I don't take orders from you.
How about running?
You're safe now.
Why have you been avoiding me?
Excuse me. Can you direct me to the nearest subway station?
He has a nimble mind.
The prisoners tried to escape.
I found out something interesting today at work.
I know everybody here.
I hope nothing goes wrong.
Tom took a walk in the park.
The size of a man's laundry bill is no criterion of his income.
We both fell asleep.
How soon are you going shopping?
Nobody backed up what I said.
Do you have earrings on?
How late may I call you?
What are you planning to do after this is over?
For now, I will wait at the hotel.
This is reality.
I plan to tell Tom about you.
Do you know what it's called?
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
She showed me his album.
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
This window is bulletproof.
I can't stay long. I have plans.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
Have you solved all the problems yet?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I was just in time for the last train.
Tom pretended to be busy.
Were you even tempted?
I'd like to thank everyone who helped.
Tom and Mary worked out their problems.
This is twice as large as that.
You're very attractive.
I did everything I could to help Tom find a job.
I was supposed to do that yesterday.
Where exactly did you go?
Did anybody see you?
Don't say I didn't warn you.
I'll be ready next time.
Don't count on it.
You must allow for his youth.
You're right.
I interpreted what he said in French into Japanese.
Tom ate both of my sandwiches.
Did you write your name?
Yesterday, I ran into my teacher at the amusement park.
I don't know when I can take a break.
They don't need me anymore.
It is Saturday.
I'm sure we can work this out.
Please show me your stamp album.
Did I surprise you?
I don't like your friends.
There are signs of growing tensions between the two countries.
A light rain was falling.
Would you like me to go there with you?
I thought you were my friend.
I was unconscious.
From time to time, I want to relax and forget everything.
He ran away with the money.
I'm strong enough.
I think we can help each other.
We worried a lot about you.
Take her to the OR.
Tom drives safely.
Take care!
You won't be needing that again.
I can't believe it's true.
Nice of you to drop by.
I was ready to do it.
My bicycle needs to be repaired.
I really am sorry.
He drinks to excess.
If you alter the plan, you must inform the team members of the changes.
Sometimes it seems that everybody hates me.
I feel great right now.
From this point, we'll go on by car.
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
She couldn't convince him to ride a horse.
She sat on the bed as her mother braided her hair.
I only study in the library.
Are you close to your family?
Give me back my glasses.
He sat on the bench.
If you could do it, would you?
How much is it?
Do it when you have time.
How do you know what color it is?
A dog is a man's best friend.
She decided to have the operation.
Let's wrap up this work now and go out drinking.
They're waiting for you.
We've been talking about you.
They agreed to work together.
I have misjudged you.
I wasn't able to believe him at first.
This knife has served me well.
I am sorry for you.
I just don't want to be disappointed again.
Tom was heartbroken when Mary told him she was leaving him.
They would like to stay at home.
The police still have no leads.
I had the same thing happen to me last month.
I know none of the three men.
I want you to be my partner.
Thanks for the tea.
He lost face.
You're totally right.
The Amazon is fed by a large number of tributaries.
Do you know what this is called?
Are you good at tennis?
Come on, sing with me.
She wrote a book about the bird.
They let me go.
We have no extra money.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
He asked her if she knew him.
He disagrees with his relatives.
Tom is madly in love with Mary.
We've already talked about this.
It is high time you started a new business.
Don't approach the dog.
All of you look healthy.
Tom isn't Mary's husband.
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
There's a park near my house.
I can't force you to do anything.
This is your last opportunity.
She is a poor cook.
I must look a sight.
Where should we go?
Real men go to the gym to pump iron, not to do aerobics.
I really am glad you're here.
They're against animal abuse.
Did you paint this?
I would like an air-conditioned room.
Tom let go of Mary's hand.
The prisoners were set free.
Are there enough chairs?
Do you want the long version or the short version?
We did not help him, so he made it by himself.
What would you do?
Please turn on the television.
I'm not sure I have enough time to clean my room before I go to school.
I never did it again.
I'm not sure.
They elected him chairman.
I'm in Boston all this week.
She has always been a popular actress.
You should eat vegetables.
She ran outside half-naked.
You'll be the first to know.
I'm tired of dancing.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
This tastes like tea.
You're a traitor.
He doesn't listen.
I am frying fish.
He was sentenced to community service.
Stop me if you've heard this one.
That one is all yours.
Don't act surprised.
I hate that you have to leave.
Won't you come and see me this weekend?
What do you need?
I had to climb over the wall.
Just act as if nothing has happened.
Why do you always want to do things the hard way?
We must start at the beginning.
Promise me that you'll help Tom.
You are important.
He comes here once a month.
I got there ahead of time.
It's no use trying anything.
I am more beautiful than you.
It's out of the question.
He was in critical condition.
I don't feel safe here anymore.
I suspect you're wrong.
The Japanese have dark eyes.
I'm still studying French.
I'm not your enemy.
France is in western Europe.
It was an interesting debate.
Tom didn't believe Mary.
What gives you the right to ask?
If you look carefully, you'll see that the box has a false bottom.
I admire your dedication.
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.
Looking at your Facebook friends' photos is a waste of time.
Nobody encouraged her.
Does your mom know?
I listen to jazz sometimes.
Turn your papers in.
I promise you I'll stay with you until your father arrives.
I'm happy enough.
The contract expires next year.
The car cut to the left.
You are the only one who can help me.
I'm pretty good at math.
I know you must be afraid.
That's foolish.
I needed a change.
Do not do that.
Hold it with both hands.
I'm coming right away.
An article about our school appeared in the newspaper.
I can't predict the future.
Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
We really don't have a choice.
I appreciate your cooperation.
You're very generous.
Why are you imitating me?
Mother Nature is generous.
She breaks a dish every time she washes dishes.
I didn't want to know.
The section chief accepted the proposal.
Tom won't come home.
Tom didn't have enough money to go home by bus.
I need you right now.
She has known him for a long time.
I want to find a box for this.
I went there to meet him.
Scream as loud as you can.
His illness may be cancer.
Your phone is ringing again.
She was ready to help him with cleaning the house.
She's a model.
I remember many things.
With his new job, he's taken on more responsibility.
It was foolish of him to waste his money on such trifles.
It looks like you've got a green thumb.
I'll be seeing him tomorrow.
Why on earth do you want to know that?
Liquor is not sold at this store.
We were passengers.
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
I think you look great.
I like you as a friend.
You should try to write more legibly.
The mechanic fixed my car without charging me a dime.
Hurry! Tom says it's urgent.
Is there any salt left?
They're not criminals.
Even if it costs 10,000 yen, I must buy the dictionary.
Hand over your weapons.
He's afraid of the sea.
The book was published posthumously.
Luna is a reliable person.
After you.
I'm from Colombia.
I love listening to you guys sing.
Tom closed his eyes.
I have no one to go to for advice.
Don't you ever say that again.
Please let me off in front of that building.
They're bringing him in for questioning now.
It's a pity that he can't get married to her.
Come here right now.
Nobody knows why he left the town.
There isn't enough coffee for everybody.
I'm about the same age as you.
It was snowing that day.
I'm famous.
Don't you like Chinese food?
The choice is all up to you.
I'm afraid I have to go now.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
This text is aimed at beginners.
I owe you a dinner.
He is fluent in French.
I completely approve of this.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Beware of imitations.
I don't know what I owe you.
Drug addiction is a cancer in modern society.
That's one of mine.
I need it as quickly as possible.
Children should obey authority.
Either you or he has to attend the meeting.
A new topic came up in conversation.
Tom bought me everything I wanted.
Why on earth would I do that?
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
We easily figured out the password.
That student raised his hand to ask a question.
I saw someone.
You can't keep this a secret.
You may open the window.
She was advised by him to listen to her doctor.
I'd like to buy a present for my son. Do you have any good ideas?
He let us go.
He was tired so he went to bed.
I want to hear you scream.
How could anybody not like this?
I am writing a letter.
He can't do it.
Who was killed?
She was accused of telling a lie.
There were 215 votes for the motion and 15 votes against it.
Can we have a moment alone?
He is used to talking to foreigners.
I don't have a girlfriend anymore.
I meant no harm.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
Can I see that?
The doors were closed.
Ignore them.
Ask me anything you like.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
It is out of the question.
I'm wasted.
Tom didn't want to play golf with Mary's father.
I braked suddenly.
We saw it on the news.
We're being attacked.
She is in love with him.
The policeman didn't believe the thief.
You don't sound very confident.
The dog was dying.
We can pay.
I'm sorry to upset your plans.
Don't you want to go to the party?
Raise up your left hand.
I'm a little drunk.
Today, we had two false alarms.
You're awesome.
She asked me whether she could use the telephone.
It may have been Tom that wrote this note.
I just wanted to say that I love you.
I have to make a decision.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
Glasses and dishes were broken.
I can't focus on two things at the same time.
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
Most were unable to read or write.
Never hesitate to tell the truth.
German is the best language in the world.
I'm losing weight.
He got lost on his way to the village.
I'll wait for you in the lobby.
He taught me how to drive.
The goods were transported by ship.
I'm a French citizen.
He advised caution.
Do you need to drink wine?
Will you pay cash?
No one in his class can run faster than he does.
I thought you were working.
I take a bath every day.
He'll never forgive me.
We grew up together.
She asked me to bring them.
Who are you talking to?
Do it when you have time.
Does he have any brothers?
Make your move.
The young lady carried a child in her arm.
I think it's better for us to adopt his plan.
I've been thinking about it.
I remember when I was about your age.
Let's do this again. It's been a lot of fun.
We need to be a little more efficient.
Could I borrow a saw?
I used to ride my bike to school, but now I take the bus.
I lost my keys.
You can't just make everyone do what you want them to.
We met before.
I am from France.
It was so cold yesterday that I stayed home.
Tell me again where you live.
London is among the world's largest cities.
He was punished for lying.
I want to stretch my legs.
He is able to swim like a fish.
They hate us.
What if he fails?
The projector doesn't work.
I had hardly reached the school when the bell rang.
Don't touch my stuff.
I'll try to fix it later.
We can talk outside.
The joke's on us.
This is based on fact.
I think of you all the time.
I hope it rains.
Don't be too hard on me.
As you like.
They are hardly likely to come at this late hour.
Is there still any sugar?
There are a lot of books in his room.
How can you be sure of that?
Old habits are hard to break.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
It looks like you've regained your confidence.
I thought we could talk.
There's another meaning, too.
We're pretty confident.
She taught me how to swim.
The joke's on you.
I have an audition today.
I feel good after a workout.
Maybe we shouldn't do that today.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
She found confrontations very upsetting.
You can't just come in here and start ordering people around.
You should smoke less.
No one told me anything.
Pass me the butter, please.
It's not as easy as you think.
I have to be careful.
Why did you come to Japan?
You can go to the station by bus.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I can't control what happens.
I caught a bad cold last week.
I hope it's not true.
That would be a waste of their talents.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
I'd like to hear a lot more about your trip.
What're you doing today?
You don't have the qualifications to lead a group.
Looks like I will become a dad.
I want to be alone for a while.
Tom concealed his anger from Mary.
Please give my best regards to your parents.
You cannot be serious.
I didn't realize you were serious.
Are you telling me the truth?
Something's happening here.
He isn't the only one with this opinion.
She wept the entire night.
His career is on the line.
You're welcome to come with us if you want to.
We're dedicated.
She has a bicycle.
All his friends backed his plan.
It was almost a decade ago, on May 8th, 1980, that Mount St. Helens erupted.
Open the safe.
You were scared, weren't you?
I was chosen to do that.
Have you ever been in prison?
You are free to go.
What did he look like?
What's in the bag?
Tom needs some new clothes.
Do you think your car will make it?
She advised him to take a rest, but he didn't follow her advice.
I spoke with my family.
Are you still married?
Are you looking for me?
Bread and milk are good foods.
I'd like a receipt, please.
Whose side are you on?
I can lend you some money if you need some.
We'll all be there together.
How could you know?
You're very busy.
What are some foods you usually eat with your children?
That's very mature of you.
Tom won't be able to do it by himself, so we need to ask someone to help him.
You should at least wear a tie.
Talking in the library is not allowed.
I hope something good happens before the day is over.
Get in. I'll drive you somewhere.
I don't want to be involved in that matter.
I thought I heard you.
That's what I'm counting on.
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
Can you tell the difference?
You're a good liar.
The rumor spread all over the town.
She met the man of her dreams.
You'll have to take his place in case he can't come.
She is collecting material for a book.
No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it.
I won't close the door.
What time did you close the store last night?
Tom disappeared into the crowd.
Someone has torn two pages out of this book.
Please air the futon.
Could you leave me one?
Traveling was much more difficult in those days.
This camera is less expensive than that one.
Hand me the hammer, will you?
I'd love to dance with you.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
I'm glad that you understand.
It gets worse.
I have good hearing.
You're so sweet.
Why did you accept this assignment?
Could you help us after school?
How could you do that?
He showed me his collection of stamps.
Let's get divorced.
You reach him by calling this number.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Why bother?
How do you feel about it?
He has the same camera as I have.
I will warn him.
Do you have any books in French?
How long have you been in jail?
Tom is in a good mood today.
I want to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
You're not a millionaire.
I'm sure he'll leave early.
I didn't fall in love.
Tom burst out laughing.
Tom ignored our advice.
I saw a plane.
Tom understands the risks.
We have to warn them.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
Long, long ago, there lived an old man and his wife.
That school looks just like a prison.
Tom usually has a glass of wine before dinner to whet his appetite.
You can't be in two places at once.
There are dangers that threaten both men and women.
Do you have work experience?
Who can predict what will happen in the future?
What foods, if any, do you avoid eating?
So, why are you here?
We have to postpone our departure.
Are we safe here?
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
I got you all right where I want you.
I've actually heard of this.
I was happy for him.
Tom ignored Mary all morning.
The flag is up.
Tell me why you think that.
Do you think I'm ugly?
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.
Her voice sounds very beautiful.
Do you want something?
We think the world of you.
I think you should leave Tom alone.
It was horrendous.
What he says makes no sense at all.
Could the situation worsen?
Take that back.
Are you looking for someone?
We're slowing down.
It was not conclusive.
That sounds scary.
He tried to gain her affection.
No one knows where we are.
My children had eaten all the cookies by the time I got home.
That is where you are wrong.
My birthday falls on Sunday.
He has a nice personality.
I go to bed very early.
Can I speak to you a moment?
Tom still needs practice.
When it rains, she takes the bus.
I really do hope that you'll do that without complaining.
What's the most convenient way to get to Tokyo Station?
I knocked, but no one opened the door.
He received a large sum of money in compensation for his injury.
Do you have to do this right now?
I know what you want to talk about.
I'm not a psychic.
I had to stop.
Do I have to go to the party?
What a big boy he is!
There is hope.
I am very happy with it.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
You know it as well as I do.
Have you finished writing your composition?
Tom locked himself in his room and cried.
Did you have fun tonight?
You may go at once.
I love hanging out with you.
He is the greatest living artist.
I really think you should leave.
There is a lady downstairs who wants to speak to you.
He is a good carpenter.
I'm not going to get involved.
We're waiting for you to leave.
Thank you for stopping by.
That's just a cheap publicity stunt.
We all have missed you.
I was trying to tell him what had really happened, but he cut me short.
I like your style.
They robbed me blind.
You had better go to the dentist.
Tom wouldn't accept my apology.
I'll take care of it later.
You can come to visit us anytime you want.
He fell in love with her.
Get me out of here now.
How many were wounded?
Would you be willing to help?
He caught the first train and got there just in time.
I think we all know what's happening.
They were surprised by what they saw.
You don't have to take an examination.
I'm here to ask for your help.
That's very considerate of you.
The wind is shifting.
It was such a lovely day that everybody was feeling happy and cheerful.
Try not to laugh.
Would you mind shutting the door?
I will give these tickets to whoever wants them.
A dog has a sharp sense of smell.
I can understand your language.
Tom must be really worried.
The gate needs to be closed.
I had my shoes cleaned.
I retired in 2013.
Please put your cigarette out.
My favourite game is football.
Smith died of a heart attack.
Is it time you need?
My father doesn't drink hard liquor.
The war had united the American people.
How far is it from here to the sea?
It'll take some time until we have enough money to buy a new tractor.
You must read the textbook closely.
He returned home for the first time in ten years.
Be a good girl.
Take your umbrella with you in case it rains.
Why did you quit?
My mother does not always get up early.
I don't like this place.
What kind of training have you had?
He left the office without saying a word to anyone.
The exhibition was very impressive.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
It was his own fault.
What do you say we buy everyone a drink?
Did I give you enough time?
How good are you?
I wrote a letter in English.
When did you finish it?
Do you mind if we sit down?
We're a group.
Please stay at my house tonight.
I'm sure about his name.
She wouldn't let up until I agreed to go to the movies with her.
I don't know your name.
Do you remember how we met?
We have no money.
Can you identify them?
I may be able to come to your office Monday afternoon.
He listened to my opinion.
An athlete must keep in good condition.
He has been studying for two hours.
He will be at home tomorrow.
I spoke with Tom this morning.
Why don't you tell me why you think it happened?
Tom says that Mary definitely doesn't want to be married.
My father was in the navy.
There was a modern-looking coffee table in the center of the room.
If the weather is good, I'll go.
His girlfriend did it for him.
Don't believe everything that you hear.
His essay was full of original ideas.
My sister will get married early next year.
Make it smaller.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
They don't always obey their parents.
What do you want for your birthday?
I didn't ask you to do that.
I'm really proud of you.
Rumors of defeat were circulating.
Tom couldn't sleep last night.
How did it feel?
She speaks too much.
Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can.
They walked down the street singing a song.
Tom and Mary never listen to me.
Why are you being mean to me?
It appears that he is mistaken.
You can't just sit here all day.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
She told him to try harder.
I don't want to tell my girlfriend that.
Follow that car.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.
Why are you doing this?
I know what it's like to be alone.
How did you get a naked picture of me?
He put great emphasis on spoken English.
You're really annoying.
I'm going to figure this out.
I don't know what the answer is.
I lost.
Where can I obtain a map of Europe?
A beautiful woman was seated one row in front of me.
I read the book from cover to cover.
We can't get out of this.
I'm interested in the history of Australia.
Do you want to use mine?
Will you show me the picture?
He let me work in this office.
No, I didn't go.
I have no further questions.
They did not have much food to eat.
English is spoken in a lot of countries.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
I want you to do it at once.
I have a stuffed-up nose.
Tom sounds angry.
Don't smoke in bed.
It's difficult to transplant an old tree.
Are you traveling alone?
Tom will never know.
I'm not making any plans.
You have gone too far.
You probably just want to be alone.
You're a wonderful woman.
I like all my classes.
This is just the beginning.
How long will you stay here?
What you're doing right now is a crime.
He set his house on fire.
Let's take a 10-minute break.
It may be impossible to get a completely error-free corpus due to the nature of this kind of collaborative effort. However, if we encourage members to contribute sentences in their own languages rather than experiment in languages they are learning, we might be able to minimize errors.
The dog followed me to my home.
Do you want in or not?
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
I have been to London twice.
I'm just going to run down to the bank.
Look at that big dog.
Tom opened the balcony window.
Tell me I'm not dreaming.
I just can't do that here.
Tom is scared of ghosts.
Look at the blackboard.
I made this chair.
Please let me know if it hurts.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
Her voice trembled with rage.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
He passed the test as was expected.
I don't want to offend you.
Did you buy flowers?
Please turn off the TV.
Almost no one believed him.
Have you ever been kissed?
You'd better start now.
I haven't finished my work.
She did nothing but cry all day.
The baby is crying.
Tom lived in Boston for a long time.
Is this the bus to Oxford?
The leaves on trees have turned red.
I have run short of money.
The bishop took pity on the desperate immigrants.
Out of my way, boy.
His father got records of bird songs for him.
I bribed them.
No one's going to save you now.
It's completely normal.
Anyone who criticizes him is asking for trouble.
I like coffee better than tea.
He always leaves the window open while he sleeps.
I'll be ready in a second.
You are a good person.
I didn't know Tom was going to do it.
I know that can't really happen.
I first met Tom when I was a little kid.
How about this one?
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
You should get your eyes examined.
How dare you enter my house without permission!
That's my cat.
The plane flew over the mountain.
I'll pay you.
She cooks for him every day, but he doesn't appreciate it.
She barely ate her lunch.
He has no children.
What's the commotion?
Beauty is but skin deep.
Let me talk.
I think it's time for me to change my plans.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Her birthday party will be held tomorrow evening.
She waved goodbye to him.
You don't need to wait.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
Who's ready to order?
We like doing things our own way.
She stood close to her husband.
What's that in your hands?
Can you see the picture?
He used a big piece of paper to make the bag.
Why is she doing this?
Everywhere you look you can see damage caused by the earthquake.
Tom likes them.
That's not how I see it.
Tom is my only real friend.
Someday she'll have to pay for what she's done.
I'm interested in the history of Australia.
It's not such a big problem. You're worrying way too much.
I really don't want to sit in that room.
Against all expectations, we became good friends.
You're the one who trained me.
Are you a law student?
Aren't you going to report it?
I don't like your suggestion.
Tom said he was busy.
She accused me of making a mistake.
Far from being a failure, it was a great success.
I think it's time for me to start taking my responsibilities seriously.
I hope your family is well.
They cleared the road of snow.
I knew what Tom meant.
I have to be back home by seven.
Cut that out!
Have you tried Japanese beer?
It's snowing.
He made believe he was a doctor.
The flame flickered for a moment, then died out.
Tom always shouts when he is angry.
The music carried me back to my childhood.
It has been a long time since I saw him.
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!
Call me when you get settled in.
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk.
Are you Chinese?
So, are you seeing anyone?
Could you describe to the jury what happened?
When did the accident take place?
I like to walk in the rain.
Have you ever been arrested?
I'm almost sure of it.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Can they see me?
Where were you last night?
She was a great help to me.
I didn't recognize what it was.
How can this be?
Do you understand her?
I have to speak with you immediately.
He is not so tall.
Could you pass me the salt, please?
They are very big apples.
She lives next door to him.
He stood face to face with his enemy.
How old were you when you learned to write your name?
Can anyone tell me what I should do next?
The man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital.
You need a drink.
My father is oblivious to the emotional pain his abuse caused me.
He's a man of his word, so you can count on him.
I told Mary that I loved her.
You will always be welcome.
I like both of them very much.
They had no beards, no hair and no eyebrows.
My brother makes it a rule to look over the newspaper before going to his office.
I must have caught a cold.
If you ever come to town, come to see me.
Next week, I'm taking the plane to Chicago.
I couldn't stop laughing.
Our health is our most precious possession.
Do you really want to know the truth?
You are expecting too much of her.
I just wanted to clarify that.
You're welcome.
This is where you're wrong.
I wouldn't recommend that.
What's new with you?
I'm your lawyer.
They are very big.
I saw a house with a red roof.
I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
You can take whatever you like.
You're all alone.
Only one person survived the accident.
I left you a note.
I need you to check on something.
I'm going to do an internship at a local company.
I know you're not serious.
I don't care for the way he talks.
I wasn't aware that you were feeling so bad.
Tom sipped some coffee.
I don't know if I should stay or run.
Tom's father left his family.
I just want to hear your reasons.
Tom was impatient to see Mary again.
I remember that guy.
There is a bus stop near our school.
They forgot to lock the door.
This is a very serious issue.
Tom trusts you.
Some of these apples are bad.
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
He stubbed out his cigar in the ashtray and stood up to leave.
Tom obviously didn't know about it.
Please help yourself.
I've finished all except the last page.
I want that more than anything.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
I'm not sure I agree.
I want you to speak frankly.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
Those chairs are in the way.
What were you doing at that time?
Foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious.
I really appreciate all your help.
I wish I had known about this when I was a kid.
Teachers should never make fun of students who make mistakes.
This is the house where he was born.
My sister didn't help me.
Our daughter burned her finger with a match.
I dislike being alone.
The two boys look more alike than I thought.
How did you hear the news?
Don't put it on my desk.
He said the same thing over and over again.
I can't imagine life on another planet.
That's not what I said.
I wanted the best.
She has a flower in her hand.
I really like him!
Tom could do that.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
How about running?
Have you read the FAQ?
You recognize her, don't you?
He is a pioneer in this field.
Tom has been beaten up pretty badly.
I forgot to tell you something.
I continued working.
You are a beautiful butterfly.
How much does that cost?
Fill the tires with air.
I'm going to miss you, too.
The baby is sleeping.
I think we should break up.
You don't seem very pleased.
I think you're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
To tell the truth, I don't like him.
That's idle talk.
I can hardly walk.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Naples is a picturesque city.
Tom wants to be a diplomat.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
We saw the sun sink below the horizon.
Be careful not to fall.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
I was thrown off guard.
If you are not satisfied with your share, I'll make it a bit more attractive.
She should be charged with murder.
I'm catching on.
I will say something about it.
He has a good memory.
May I call you tomorrow?
Tom and I have work to do.
The number of students in this class is limited to 15.
My girlfriend was crying.
That's not happening.
Why are you being mean to me?
I love this store.
Is tomorrow a holiday?
We have to come together as a team.
I'd like to give you the key, but I can't.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
He resigned from his office.
Give me what you have in your hand.
Tom fainted at the sight of the needle.
I need you to show me what you have in your bag.
I wonder what I'll find in the box.
Nowadays anybody can get books.
Children walk around from door to door on Halloween night.
Does this make me look fat?
Tom waited patiently for three hours, then left.
You may take the book.
I think you'll find this interesting.
You understand this, don't you?
I didn't really want to help.
I don't know what this is.
We're on the same team, right?
I came from China.
Have you been here since?
Tom is usually on time and Mary is usually late.
Tom doesn't really like Mary, even though he says he does.
That restaurant prepares two thousand meals every day.
My college has dormitories.
He must be stupid to believe such a thing.
Ain't he cute?
We're too weak.
Tom didn't get home until after 2:30 this morning.
They're similar.
It isn't expensive.
They asked for an increase of salary.
She must have forgotten all about the promise.
This is how I made it.
She flatters herself by thinking that she is beautiful.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
I'm ready.
He's not going.
This fork is dirty.
Tom asked an awkward question.
I am all ears.
Lay down on the couch.
She rejected him.
She wept bitterly.
Maybe I'll go swimming after school.
Don't drink too much coffee.
At least thirty students were absent.
She has about 2,000 books.
One of your neighbors complained.
Please eat something.
What time did you arrive there?
You're in pain, aren't you?
I'm still not sure I can do that.
I can't take my eyes off her.
Tom still loves you.
Try it on.
He is not fond of sports, and I am not either.
Tom ended up in jail.
She didn't want him to play poker.
Stop right there, please.
Don't complicate the problem by raising new issues.
You're very sophisticated.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
A lot's happened while you've been away.
You may choose one of them.
A bird is known by its song and a man by his way of talking.
I liked it.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
Tom was reading a letter written in French.
He employs a maid.
I think it's you who should apologize to her.
Let me handle this.
It's important that you hear this.
That was a pretty good move.
Do you know who this car here belongs to?
I'm proud of my family.
If it rains tomorrow, I'm not going to the meeting.
Look at this mess.
Save it on the external hard drive.
I was more than a little disappointed.
I just wanted to say good luck.
She doesn't have any friends or relatives to take care of her.
She sang better than usual.
It's nice to be a role model for others.
Just give me one more chance.
Tom was always there for me.
What are you doing now?
She was a bit late.
They shouldn't let children swim in that river.
I know the drill.
Don't you have anything else?
Write me.
Maybe we should just give up.
I need some sleep.
No one knows.
Your conduct is absolutely shameful.
We got off on the wrong foot.
I learned nothing from the teacher.
I think that it's going to rain soon.
He took a taxi in order not to miss the train.
I can't hear you well.
I remember you.
I had a good time at the party.
Doing it that way will take a long time.
What she said made him angry.
Employers sometimes exploit their workers.
I don't know much else.
He did not speak at all.
May I try it?
I got home a little late last night.
I just heard something.
It's stealing.
He suggested that we take a short rest.
English has become an international language.
There's still so much left to do.
Did you tell Tom why you're here?
Make up your own mind.
Where do you want us to go?
Can you catch the chicken?
Is anything broken?
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
You're pathetic.
Stay right there.
I will kill you.
Everyone makes mistakes.
You don't seem to realize how serious this is.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
She has fallen in love with me.
There's not much to say.
I can't do this anymore.
I like doing stuff like that.
Everyone likes you.
Tom quit his job.
My car won't start.
I'm afraid I can't.
I can't drink coffee.
Nobody wants to work with you.
Tom turned off the air conditioner.
I'd like to have a word with you.
I can't wait all day.
His ideas never earned him a dime.
Are you ready now?
Sometimes I see him at the club.
Where did all this come from?
I don't really know anything.
There is no progress without communication.
You didn't eat much lunch, did you?
I would rather go out.
I was aware of being watched.
I'd like you to drive.
I just want to make sure we all agree.
I grew these carrots myself.
An eagle is flying in the sky.
This sounds very interesting.
Tom put the envelope on the table.
Few students know how to read Latin.
That's not what I was doing.
He made me a suit.
How about running?
My mother gets up early every morning.
He said that he had been in California for ten years.
Do you like French literature?
I hear from my mother every month.
I think Tom already knows.
I can't do this work alone.
Do you know how to play chess?
In addition to about 30,000 yen, the wallet contained his driver's license.
Is everything all right up there?
She started talking with a stranger.
My clock seems to be broken.
This doesn't make sense to me either.
Things don't always turn out the way we plan.
I can barely understand what he's saying.
Do you know how to do this?
He was named after his grandfather.
It's terrible.
He'll never show it, but I think that deep down, he's seriously worried.
Tom always speaks in French.
I can't draw a bird.
He speaks broken French.
You're very rude.
I had a drink or two before you came.
Don't be afraid to experiment.
I want to see how it ends.
He is what we call a scholar.
If it rains tomorrow, I won't go.
The road is jammed with cars.
I won't eat breakfast today.
It was my destiny.
You get used to it.
This boat is seaworthy.
I tried to learn the melody by heart.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
He's back from his travels in Central Asia.
We have plenty of time.
I'd like to be woken up tomorrow at 6:30.
Who's in control?
I wonder if there's a market for something like that.
Is it your first day at school?
Let's not be enemies.
Are you giving me another chance?
That's a horse of a different color.
I'll go wherever you want me to go.
Why are you all dressed up?
The boy opened the window, although his mother told him not to.
We have plenty of time tonight.
It's always been like that.
He has made up his mind to buy the car.
She is just a wallflower.
Tom had a knife in his hand.
They were forecasting rain for today.
He had made enemies during his early political life.
What's going to be different?
I'll be sixteen years old next month.
They often make fun of the boss.
I never saw her again.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
How is that possible?
I've won.
I hate milk.
Since the accident, Tom has given up hope of becoming a professional dancer.
We're concerned for your safety.
He retires next spring.
There is a gold coin.
I thought doing this would be easy, but we've been working all day and we're still not finished.
Leave me alone now.
Don't scare me like that, OK?
I can do without his help.
I'd like to go somewhere else now.
What would you take for the lot?
What do you seek?
The sun has not risen yet.
I have a comment.
Would you sing us a song in English?
The robot went out of control.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride in his success.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
She blamed him for all her problems.
I could see that.
He is acquainted with the custom.
I can't see what you mean.
You can't just quit.
Mary is quite attractive.
Either you or she has to go there.
I met her on campus yesterday.
He could not believe his ears.
I have to go to the bathroom.
What if you were able to buy the house you've always dreamed of?
I got a long letter from my folks.
Are you on the committee?
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
He delivered a very long speech yesterday.
I'm not a good liar.
I was surprised.
I will be waiting for you in my room.
I don't really like him.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
We all know what happened here.
Are you getting tired?
I'm thrilled to go.
This is a lot more fun than studying.
I need a volunteer.
Check out these stats.
You don't have to tell me twice.
These figures don't add up.
I took sides with them in the argument.
Is everything okay?
He wondered why she did not come.
For your own safety, never ride in a car with a drunk driver.
This is something I must face alone.
I love the sun.
Carry this for me.
Look at the cat.
What are you still doing here?
It's a monster storm.
Thirty-four of them were lawyers.
Please stop.
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
I turned on the radio to listen to the news.
The wind was howling.
Wait in the waiting room.
I have an idea she will come today.
He is always friendly to me.
I've been expecting good news from them.
May I visit an art gallery?
I wouldn't have dreamed of it.
Did it go well today?
This chair is Tom's.
He worked hard to save up some money.
What a big house you have!
She goes to school.
I smiled at everybody.
What did I forget to say?
I'll call him.
There have been a lot of complaints about that policy.
How did I let this happen?
Do you remember how we met?
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
We don't think the job is done.
Here's what I'm doing.
No one likes war.
Buffaloes have big horns.
I don't think we want to go down that road.
That man stole all of his money.
Tom helped Mary dye her hair.
How will we pay our debts?
The goods were transported by ship.
What are you cooking?
It is not far away from the hotel.
I don't think I can walk any faster.
I'm nothing without you.
This is the doghouse that I made myself.
Did they live here?
I'm going to leave one night early.
I find that offensive.
The station is about three miles from here.
I love Christmas music.
I'm doing fine.
I've decided to go a little further.
The climate here is very similar to that of England.
That boy looks like Tom.
You were always very kind.
They don't like my friends.
I appreciate your support.
Someone's talking.
Why did you side with him instead of me?
The victim is thought to have taken a large quantity of poison by mistake.
Your name was mentioned.
Can you give me another example?
I just moved here.
I don't know what this word means. I'll look it up in the dictionary.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Don't be scared of making mistakes.
You don't look Japanese.
We have captured one of their spies.
Desperate needs lead to desperate deeds.
You're no different.
If the alarm rings, walk, don't run.
I thought it'd be fun to sing a few songs together.
I'm slow to adapt to new situations.
What happened to your guitar?
That's what's supposed to happen.
Think outside the box.
My grandmother on my mother's side lives in Osaka.
It's not our anniversary.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Be polite to everyone.
I already speak French.
I'd really rather be alone right now.
It's getting late.
I really hope so.
Business is business.
I bought many books.
Don't let me influence you.
Does he know how you feel?
Does Tom have a lot of friends?
Somebody tried to kill me.
Put another log on the fire.
I'm dissatisfied.
I've managed to stop the bleeding.
It's very onerous.
What does USB stand for?
I asked where she lived.
Brown is not her natural hair color.
He has brown eyes.
My sister has long legs.
She watched him continue to fight as hard as he could.
She mistook my brother for me.
A woman fell from a ship into the sea.
Did he get a receipt?
Since I'm here, let me help you.
I locked the door.
We all have secrets.
My son has a black beard.
You're the girl of my dreams.
My husband is in jail.
Tom didn't get paid as much as they told him they'd pay him.
Be merciful.
You've been infected.
You'll be missed by your friends.
I shouldn't worry.
What else do you want to do?
She must be visiting England this summer.
Oil and water don't mix.
Tom used to be a heavy smoker.
I don't have a family.
I want to try it.
I suggest we don't even try.
You can read this book.
We're retiring.
Please put your age on the form.
His English is not bad, seeing that he has studied for only two years.
I don't want you to get involved.
I wonder if you could help us.
Where did you live?
It's backwards compatible.
It's very small.
I'm a shutterbug.
Selling cars is my business.
Tom forgot to do his homework.
How did you lose it?
The post office is closed today.
I don't want to dance.
I can't believe the way everyone is reacting.
We have to wait for him.
I've got to get going.
I strolled along the streets to kill time.
Would you open the door?
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
How are things going?
I spend a few hours a day maintaining my website.
Are you sure of it?
Keep the child away from the pond.
The potato was so hot that it burned my mouth.
He asked a very good question.
I finally got a job.
Let me explain it with a diagram.
You've worked hard.
She urged him to drive carefully.
Call me up when you get there.
Unless you hurry, you will be late for school.
Do you have some money?
Tom doesn't like the rainy season.
I wonder if Tom is still eating lunch.
It's getting ridiculous.
They basked in the sun.
Tom has changed a lot since high school.
Please let me know if it hurts.
We just want you to tell the truth.
These scissors are new.
She argued with him about money.
I got out of the car at 40th Street.
That's an order that I can't give.
I'm going to be all right.
She became more and more beautiful as she grew older.
He cannot have said that.
Tom hates Halloween.
My father is too stubborn to admit his faults.
Are you interested?
It's computer-generated.
The travelers stayed at a seaside hotel.
Just exactly what do you want me to do?
He wants the most bang for his buck.
Have you ever broken a bone?
The chances are that the bill will be rejected.
I read an exciting story.
The colonists bartered with the natives for fur.
You are now on the way to recovery.
I can't handle this without your help.
Is that really what you want?
Do you want to get drunk?
Let me see what it looks like.
I gave a homeless man twenty dollars.
Tom and Mary have broken up.
Tom seems to be an honest person.
He is familiar with Japanese culture.
He liked that.
You're the only person I know who is my age.
Is it an emergency?
What did you do at school today?
They made the decision.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
One of us will have to go.
Tom's leg is healing.
Tom is an excellent marksman.
I always make it a point to paint things as they are.
I didn't see their faces.
No one warned us.
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
She's a tough one.
I let my friend copy my homework.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
He has a headache.
I have to talk to you alone.
You have made a promise.
Fortunately, the weather was good.
Will you go?
Can my friend sleep over tonight?
There's nothing new to report.
He wants a new car.
Could you turn down the music, please?
I just don't want to talk to you.
You've grown up, Tom.
You should look this word up.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
We make progress only one step at a time.
He couldn't take it any longer.
That's an interesting piece of information.
The goods will be delivered free of charge.
That rarely happens.
I like what you've written.
He barely passed the examination.
Japan has changed significantly in the past 50 years.
Shall we add a bit more salt?
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
I think you might need me.
I would never question his honesty.
I stayed home for a week.
I will keep your advice in mind.
Of all the things Tom did last weekend, he says that windsurfing was the most fun.
It seems that he has something to do with the matter.
I know you love Tom.
Oh no!
America did away with slavery.
What's the accusation against him?
I would do it again if I had to.
Anticipating a cold winter, we bought a bigger stove.
Before you can love others, you need to be able to love yourself.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Did you have a good time on your trip to London?
How can you be so selfish?
I want to be the first to do that.
It is important to know your own limitations.
I just want to make it up to you.
The Allies wasted no time.
It's cold. It was foolish of you not to bring your coat.
I'm very ashamed of myself.
That sounds interesting.
I thought it was a fluke.
I can't explain what happened.
He opened the door.
Tell me how you did it.
Someone has walked off with my pencil.
I am terribly hungry.
Don't tease me.
I left my umbrella in the cab.
When you make the bed, don't forget to fluff up the pillows.

He runs in the park every day.
Do you have the book?
Are you allergic to peanuts?
Have you seen our museums? What do you think about them?
You're out of booze.
Now let's get down to work.
Where's my bag?
What makes you ask that?
She sued him.
It's no use trying to keep secrets from journalists.
They did the right thing.
Turn to the left.
Tom thought Mary could speak French.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
Don't try anything funny.
How are we feeling today?
The competition is fierce.
Does anyone here speak Japanese?
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
You're so bossy.
He is lazy.
I paid attention.
It has been raining since yesterday.
These boxes are heavy.
One of my wisdom teeth is coming in.
Which cup is yours?
He's starting to feel desperate.
You should mind your own business.
She invited him in.
Quote me an example.
She introduced me to him at the party.
Tom unwrapped his sandwich.
If it were not for the sun, no living creatures could exist on the earth.
You aren't like the others.
I've got them all.
You're arrogant.
The towel is wet.
I was born in Osaka, but brought up in Tokyo.
Don't underestimate your own strength.
I was somewhere else.
I took risks.
I think we'd better ask Tom what he thinks.
We are decorating the conference room.
Enjoy yourself for a change.
Which floor do you live on?
Do you have a fishing license?
I had a problem with my car.
This is a great book.
You can't be too careful these days.
Are you still playing the bassoon?
You're very generous.
You remind me of somebody.
What were you doing there?
It was impressive.
He wants to talk to you.
Do you have your laptop with you?
Eat your vegetables.
Tom made quite a lot of money in his twenties.
Is there someone with you?
He will make a good team captain.
Tom almost fainted.
Yesterday, I put honey in my tea.
Do you like my new clothes?
Can you give me another pillow?
Let's list all the reasons not to do that.
This is not enough.
They spoke briefly.
I stayed up till late at night.
Am I speaking too quickly?
Where are my books?
Your feet are swollen because your shoes are too small.
Tom has three sons, I believe.
I have always fed my dog the dog food that comes in the big green bag.
He saved money for his old age.
Tom has been very cooperative.
Do you sometimes study in the library?
I'm not persuaded.
They danced all night long.
What is your idea of a good time?
Don't point your gun at anyone.
Tom picked up a book, opened it, and started reading it.
I figured I might find you here.
She was stupid enough to believe him.
I'm sure I'll be able to find it.
The moment I walked into the room, I knew something was wrong.
You must stop him.
You're very observant.
Don't make fun of children.
Take me to your place.
Are you all ready?
Excuse me, but do you mind if ask your name?
Tom took a lot of photographs.
Who will you go with?
I'm not good-looking.
I was married at that time.
She did it for the good of the community.
We're just having a good time.
What's the job this time?
They are great friends.
Did you see anyone leave?
It seems that he's happy.
I need it today.
She wants him.
It wasn't me who started the fight.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
I don't think I was followed.
Could you please fix this flat tire?
All the money is gone.
I have very good eyesight.
I found a real bargain.
At the start of every weekend, I am both tired and happy.
It's rather cold for April.
You know I can't wait for you if you're late.
To my astonishment, my money was gone.
He is always complaining.
The man is right.
They're right behind you.
I know what they said.
Run for it!
Have you ever taken a lie detector test?
He felt utterly humiliated.
It's made of brass.
Have they made progress?
There seems to be something peculiar about the boy.
Why did you go to Tokyo?
He's a world-class scientist.
Tom is watching golf.
I have an urgent matter to attend to.
The fire destroyed the tall building.
Would anyone like some coffee?
How did it end?
Tom ran all the way home.
I have a schedule.
They were afraid of being overheard.
I know that he keeps his promise.
She married him even though she didn't like him.
I want some answers and I want them now.
I really feel like crying right now.
I've done this before.
Why don't you remember?
What did you do this time?
The teacher got well again.
I saw the man enter the room.
Did you make this doll by yourself?
Tom is a friend of mine.
Anybody want a beer?
I wish you happiness.
During the rush hours in Tokyo, traffic is heavy.
Many consumer reviews on Amazon are fake.
Tom won't answer the question.
Money has changed his life.
Are you students?
She brags about how well she can cook.
How can you not like horses?
I didn't want you to feel you were alone.
I let you catch me.
Do you enjoy living like this?
You shouldn't have gone fishing today.
How do we find it?
We're on the right track.
Tom said that Mary was ambidextrous.
Can you swim as fast as he can?
We should do better.
It is getting warmer and warmer.
It seems that the store is closed today.
This is my bicycle.
I like the sound of that.
Do you want to see something funny?
You're obnoxious.
You don't need luck.
This book will be very useful to us.
I really like that.
The teapot is whistling.
Everyone is going.
Not knowing what to say, I remained silent.
How thrilling!
She went with him to the zoo.
Who's next on the list?
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
I've been looking all over for you.
We have to sing at an old folks home today.
I'm glad to be of some help to you.
Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Don't try to pull a fast one on me!
Who is going to speak tonight?
I wash my face every morning.
His house is somewhere about here.
He has a head on his shoulders.
Am I the only one who didn't understand what was going on?
Who are you and where do you come from?
I make you nervous, don't I?
I arrived yesterday.
I'm all for that.
Tom won't give in.
There's always more to learn.
A good appetite is a good sauce.
He hasn't been doing anything since he graduated from high school.
I worry about your health.
She has snow-white skin.
This lady is Indian.
Is his pulse regular?
He has wine.
I didn't know you had a cat.
She gave him money as well as food.
Tom called to say that he'll be late.
Please drop in on your way home.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
I am interested in chess these days.
Did you just hit Tom?
You're very resourceful.
I can't trust him.
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
He watches TV every day.
Let's start with this bottle of wine.
He cleaned it up.
Just tell me what happened.
Watch closely.
No one knew who did it.
I told you so.
She put the key in her bag.
What did you make?
Her home is in the suburbs.
Lead the way.
They forgot to lock the door.
I was relaxed.
Could you please kiss a little bit more slowly?
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes.
Do you think I'm right?
I'm going to wear these shoes on our date tonight.
I love the way you talk.
Tom stayed up all night. Now he's too tired to work.
Are you angry?
What don't you have?
We'll begin shortly.
We wanted to wish you good luck.
Men talk about women all the time.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
You should have telephoned in advance.
It's time for me to go, kids.
Don't forget your sunscreen.
I'm not panicking.
They're all alike.
I like what you did.
The dressing room is over there.
I like dark red better.
She pinched him.
Gasoline is sold by the liter.
He soon betrayed his ignorance.
She wept bitterly.
There's no need for you to study.
You're very stylish.
I'm not answering that.
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn't do that again.
Nobody saw anything.
I wish you were close to me.
I'm getting married this year.
He gave me all the money he was carrying with him.
What's the deal here?
I escaped death.
Let's chat.
He is off duty today.
The door is locked at nine every night.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
May I have a look at your ticket?
Tom is good at telling stories.
Is distilled water drinkable?
He was found mysteriously murdered.
I don't know them.
It was very windy yesterday.
I study English.
That's real funny.
I'm glad you could make it.
I've never even told my husband.
Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan.
Do the police know about this?
They're part of us.
I'm not the least bit worried about losing my job.
It's not worth reading any further.
In brief, he was wrong.
How much does that cost?
We can't promise anything.
After I graduated from college, I got a job with my father's company.
Who painted this beautiful picture?
It seems to me that this is too expensive.
It's on the sofa.
I haven't seen you for ages.
My uncle lives next to the school.
That's very nice of you to say.
No one agreed with me.
Tom looks like he's going to cry.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
I didn't drive.
I was forced to go.
I must make an apology to her.
Don't tell me you're not scared.
It's not safe there.
Trust no one.
It's in my jacket pocket.
I'm as tall as you.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
What's your best price?
You're no different.
I don't think I can answer that.
Which one of those is yours?
Please remain seated.
It can be very cold here even in May.
It's nothing to be alarmed about.
I'll stand by you no matter what happens.
I had no idea what I was doing.
Cats usually hate dogs.
She herself helped him.
She was advised by him to listen to her doctor.
She seems sad.
What we should do next is the question.
Why don't you leave Tom?
Let's end this debate.
Start a new paragraph here.
We're married now.
Come back.
Don't ask questions that you don't want to know the answer to.
Don't speak with your mouth full!
Who invented this machine?
This text isn't easy to translate.
We can still win.
Tom is a well-known singer.
I didn't realize you could speak French.
I won't mention it again.
If you can't come, please let me know ahead of time.
I need you to see this.
I wholeheartedly agree.
My mother has been dead these ten years.
I like my job just fine.
We hope this will be to your satisfaction.
Don't make me hurt you again.
They don't look happy to see us.
I'm no friend of yours.
Are you ready now?
Up until now, they've been good neighbors.
I'd rather stay.
You're not that interesting.
Don't talk about me.
School begins at nine.
That's what I want most in the world.
It's time we went home.
Could you bring us the bill, please?
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
I crossed the street.
We sent out the invitations yesterday.
I brought you a present.
Everything he says upsets me.
Tom looks a lot like someone I know.
Can I have a moment with you?
It's open.
His wife has started to work out of necessity.
Two detectives followed the suspect.
Everyone is outraged.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
Please stop talking.
I'm a beginner, too.
You're all invited.
Churches are designated on the map with crosses.
Where on earth have you been?
I'm done listening to you.
We're lazy.
I always knew you'd be back.
Can you please tell me your name once more?
I have no intention of meddling in your affairs.
I have to do what's right.
Let's just try it.
I can't believe that that just worked.
It wasn't him.
This seems too good to be true.
She says that she's lonely.
It doesn't matter which side you're on.
I stole it from Tom.
How often do you see your godparents?
Do you think that eating breakfast every day is important?
Tom is a bass player.
This is a frightening place.
I had no friends except for Tom.
Thank you in advance.
There is something about him I don't like.
The accident has caused many deaths.
It's time to party.
My work is almost finished.
I don't sleep anymore.
Are you their mother?
Both of them started laughing.
You can't keep this a secret.
Is Tom there, too?
He used his umbrella as a weapon.
I asked him what his name was.
The salesgirl couldn't open the cash register.
I thought it would be a good concert, but it wasn't.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
Are you up for it?
Your plan didn't work.
After the revolution, France became a republic.
I carried one bag, but the other one was left behind.
I don't care what you do with it.
Lock the door.
Somebody caught me by the arm.
You have done a wonderful job.
We were both afraid to talk.
You know what they can do, don't you?
I fell in the pool.
Who is absent?
Could you move the chair a bit?
I have a surprise for you guys.
From here on out, it's smooth sailing.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
All of them are different.
The boy pressed his face against the shop window.
I'm ready to leave whenever you are.
Why don't you read it for yourself?
Write down each word.
You may choose any of them.
It didn't take you long to get here.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
Tell me how to play the game.
Do you think it works?
Are you for real?
There's a church behind my house.
That's a risk you have to take.
Tom has forgotten how to do it.
He got his dander up.
We're on the wrong train.
That experiment was a failure.
Sometimes it's better to just not say anything.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
The earthquake caused widespread damage.
That's very big.
Do you want children?
I don't understand women.
That's what my friends keep telling me.
I'd like to go faster.
You have to eat before you go.
Have you finished cleaning your room yet?
Are you sure about that?
I'm tired of everything.
I left one of my books at school.
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
We're going south.
The magician had the children's attention.
I got fined.
Keep an eye on him.
My parents were proud of me.
You are very rich.
I said exactly what they wanted to hear.
Can you remember the first time we met each other?
He came to pick me up.
Are you afraid of it?
Without your help, I would have drowned.
I want you to handle this.
They were talking about you.
The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know.
We're going to stay until the end.
That door won't open.
I'm glad to see you here.
Why didn't you call the police?
I'm fascinated by cats.
We did it ourselves.
Please open the window.
Isn't that unusual?
His son has what it takes to be a good doctor.
Your hair's beautiful.
I can't take that chance.
This isn't what it looks like.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
It is cloudy now.
I just got my first tattoo.
It seems that Tom isn't here today.
I did as I was told.
We happened to be in Hokkaido then.
Tom practices the piano at least thirty minutes every day.
Tom and I are buddies.
Seeing me, the baby began to cry.
Actually, I did want to ask you one thing.
May I give you some advice?
It's okay as long as no one finds out about it.
I had a run of bad luck.
Don't you ever come back.
How is that question germane to what we're discussing?
She waited patiently for him.
Give me your phone.
Let's get the work over with so we can relax.
Yesterday was very cold so I wore a hat.
He slipped on the ice.
I looked for the key.
Her late husband was a violinist.
My wife and I prefer to spend time at home together.
This sentence is not French.
It's not about that.
I've made up my mind to come up with a better solution.
I can't hear anything because of the noise.
My mother was sick for two days.
Do you like dogs?
Look at the blackboard.
You look familiar.
I don't think about you in that way.

I stayed in bed all morning.
The commander refused to negotiate.
If anything should ever happen to me, you can look here.
Arguing never got anyone anywhere.
Where have you been up to now?
I think this is a waste of time.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
The media blew the whole thing out of proportion.
Take a sip of this.
He had a hard time making himself understood at the meeting.
We try our best.
Tom is wise.
A bunch of people died in the explosion.
Tom hasn't met Mary.
We went to the theater early, so we could be sure that everyone could get a seat.
I really appreciate you picking me up.
Can you read that?
Sorry about the mess.
We already know each other.
Tom is a fast learner.
He likes me.
Tom isn't a student.
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
You're not the first.
He tried wooing her with love poems.
Tom still thinks Mary likes him.
She is no longer the cheerful woman she once was.
Tom believes Mary is wrong.
Children are sometimes afraid of the dark.
Don't think about it. Do it.
Would you like to go for a walk?
They found us.
This bag is both good and inexpensive.
It's not true.
Didn't you hear the voice in the next room?
People were watching.
I don't think that you should worry about it too much.
I've seen a couple of Kurosawa's films.
His child behaves well.
I can't put up with that noise any longer.
Is this all for real?
Tom was arrested Monday night.
I'll be back within an hour.
Is Tom well enough to work today?
Somebody had drowned her in the bathtub.
It's not too late to walk away.
He must find work.
All of our attempts failed.
He didn't like to ask for help even if he was starving.
Tom can handle this.
I'm looking for my key.
He told us to depart at once.
It's against my principles.
It's a bad time.
He has not been able to attend school for a week.

They were stuck in the elevator for four hours.
I can't do it justice.
Save yourself.
Everyone always asks me that.
Please bring me the book next time you come.
Who phoned?
What time did you close the store last night?
Go back to the lab.
After that, he went home.
You will save your father a lot of worry if you simply write him a letter.
I swim in the summer.
This is such a waste of time.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
We sat on the grass.
Tom didn't really mean that, did he?
We're tired of waiting.
I'm too tired to think about that now.
The fish smells bad.
Don't try to keep her to yourself.
She called him on the phone.
Misfortunes rarely come singly.
We have to give Tom a chance.
I guess I just like making people happy.
I'll do anything you wish.
I want to know what's so funny.
Tom heard some shots.
You're a mean person.
I got dizzy.
This lake is deep.
My business is slow right now.

The bus is capable of carrying thirty people.
He broke down when he heard the bad news.
What do you call that contraption?
I've always liked horror movies.

I don't want you to lose.
I'll teach you how to drive a car.
They're out of their minds.
Be serious.
Tom lives in the same apartment building as Mary does.
Can't you understand that it's impossible?
Please wait until we get the results of the examination.
This is the flag of Japan.
All of a sudden, it began raining.
I wish I could believe you.
Whose car is this?
Stand back!
Keep trying.
I wanted to go swimming.
That was very good.
Tom showed Mary his stamp collection.
We saw nothing.
The two ladies smiled at each other.
She went to Paris to study music.
Do you have less expensive ones?
You don't give up too easily, do you?
I think Tom has gone away.
People of your age often have this problem.
After losing his job, he went through a very difficult time.
Is that a bullet hole?
Tom thanked everyone for waiting.
I always thought it was weird.
That's not important for you to know.
Take a deep breath, please.
The rain made me late.
I've locked the front door.
Do you want some company?
I'll do it.
She was making tea.
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
It's not that different.
I'm confident that there won't be a world war.
I didn't tell you everything.
He was involved in the trouble.
You don't sound too sure.
I ache all over.
I have enough money to buy this.
I don't worry about that.
The bag is full.
Jobs are scarce.
I'd rather go out than stay indoors.
I need some cardboard boxes to pack my possessions.
What's your favorite sport?
They were afraid of being overheard.
His play was a hit.
I like you.
I caught my finger in the door.
I don't date.
Write an essay on "Friendship".
Do you come here often?
Don't you like baseball?
She forced him to sit down.
Do you have a retirement plan?
I have no interest whatsoever in eating English food.
Do you think it's my fault?
Tom lives and works in Boston.
I helped my father yesterday.
He knows ten languages.
Mom remained in the car while Dad shopped.
You should stick those pictures in your album.
You didn't get very far.

I don't know how you lasted five years in that job.
What's your name?
They are facing financial problems.
I got my bicycle repaired.
They look happy.
I owe you a favor.
I'm the one who makes the decisions.
I want Tom fired.
My parents have gone to the airport to see my uncle off.
He wants to go.

It is better to be a coward for five minutes than dead for the rest of your life.
No one could buy anything.
They're all dead.

Thanks to you, I arrived on time.
We don't have a landline anymore.
"I don't have time to spend with my kids." "You should make time."

I just want you out of my house.
You wash the potatoes.
He publicly insulted me.
She seems to have been happy.
I asked Tom why he had never gotten married.
He was found lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
I think you need to buy a new pair of hiking boots.
He attributed his failure to bad luck.
Speak louder, please.
She owns a large mansion.
Skating on the pond is dangerous.
Do you like French wines?
She told me an interesting story.
I'm dying to see you.
We would have helped them.
She bought the dictionary, too.
This decision is final.
What's the weather like where you are?
We have two ears.
The Beatles set the world on fire with their incredible music.
I could see it was you.
They're hard to find.
I always wear a watch so I know what time it is.
I really appreciate the offer.
I think we're ready to go.
We have a lot to do.
Shall I get you a chair?
He was learning a poem.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
Can you do some shopping for me?
I'm getting more and more gray hair.
Tom and Mary realized that they weren't really compatible.
He said it as a joke.
We demand action.
Tom did exactly as I told him to do.
Move up to the front, please.
You spend too much time in front of your computer.
The three-day discussion was worthwhile.
All the cherry trees in the park are in full bloom.
Tom is due to come at noon.
It's all part of their strategy.
You still haven't told me where you live.
We're careful.
Meditation doesn't cost anything, but it takes time.
What did he say again?
He heard the sound.
It's what we've always dreamed of.
Tom is approximately the same weight as Mary.
She called him by name.
Tom is looking for a job.
I like dogs.
Can I come in now?
Don't keep me waiting here like this.
Be discreet.
I want to discuss this with your manager.
His behavior is worthy of respect.
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
Don't slam the door.
Can I eat this cake?
Tom doesn't want to do anything to hurt Mary.
I'm from out of town.
He must be crazy to treat his parents like this.
I got hammered last night.
It was less than fifteen dollars.
I couldn't care less.
I am an English teacher.
I love this sweater.
I haven't read any of his books.
You have to pay in advance.
She liked that.
Tell them we need an ambulance.
I know that tune, but I can't remember the lyrics.
Would you go to your room?
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
According to some scholars, a major earthquake could occur at any moment now.
Is there something in particular that you're looking for?
To make matters worse, it began snowing.
I'll come with you.
You were Tom's only friend.
I have a serious problem.
He's a senior.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
The results were conclusive.
Do you have a twin sister?
The line is engaged.
Are you happy in your house?
He looked at her angrily.
I know lots of songs.
Do you ever think about that girl?
Excuse me, but may I open the window?
It was a gift.
I had to get away from here.
I have never seen anyone like him.
Come here before seven o'clock.
Let's decide on the date for the picnic.
This is my younger sister.
We aren't going to stay at that hotel again.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
I asked Tom to wait a moment.
Everyone started arguing.
She recognized him immediately.
Don't let him know the truth.
He is very depressed.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
He is being very careful.
Why is Mary going with him to the picnic?
I don't understand English.
I wanted to see what would happen.
I took two aspirins for my headache.
Do you have a cellphone?
She fell in love with him.
I'm done with it.
Business is improving.
The building is on fire.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
The children tried to imitate their teacher.
Guess what that cost me.
Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
I can't get along with him.
He objected to my going out yesterday.
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation.
What did you do with the camera?
She has gone shopping.
Could you please take me back home?
Can you skip me?
I'm unambitious.
Tom is obviously tired.
How often do you see him?
Bring me today's paper, please.
My GPS works very well.
I've got to leave soon.
I don't want to take on any more work.
I know the boy.
We've still got a couple of days.
He's so thin that he looks like a skeleton.
Do you know what time that accident happened?
They formed a swim team.
He promised not to smoke.
What does this remind you of?
Almost no one believed her.
Go ahead, try it now.
Normally, I'm not afraid of planes.
They say that you never forget your first love.
Why do you want to do this?
My teacher drove me home.

You don't belong here.
No one believed him.
That was not my question.
Tom'll call.
I'll show you how to do it.
He ignored me.
Did Tom like Boston?
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
Turn it off.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!

I'd rather walk.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
You're not supposed to be in here.

You look very tired.
I've never lied to you.
I'm finished.
How do you know how deep the lake is?
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer.
Do you want to come sit by me?
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right away.
You won't stay, will you?
I have no objection to that.
I'll be nice.
I can't stop him.
I'd like you to look at something.
He's rich and powerful.
She sold all of her furniture, so she could afford to feed herself and her dog.

Tom's violent.
I'll always remember your kindness.
What's your home address?

How are your parents?
You don't have to apologize.
I hate exercising.
I'm ready to start working whenever you are.
They met for the first time in London.

She loves shopping.
Everyone seeks happiness.
Put the car into the garage.
I am very glad to see you.
Hand me that oven mitt.
I'm not expecting special treatment.
That dress is perfect for you.
At last, I passed the test.
There's something funny going on here.
I'm quite serious.
I'd never hire Tom.
My house is nice.
Were you successful?
I'd like to get away from Boston for a few days.

I need you to see this.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
What narrow stairs!
There are no comments yet.
I was too tired to walk any more.
You may stay here with me.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Tom and Mary look surprised.
This doesn't burn.
He paused to look at the poster.
Condors have never bred in zoos.
Take a walk.

Come meet everybody.
Apparently, that's not correct.

We've seen drastic changes since then.
This place isn't safe anymore.

We haven't finished.
She kept me waiting for over an hour.

You may go home now.
You'd be amazed how many times I've told Tom not to do that.
Tom was very kind to everyone.
I have different priorities than you do.
Stop! You're hurting him!
Is this fake?
Tom wants to be your friend.
You shouldn't read people's private letters without permission.
You're not as smart as me.
What happened?
I have lived in Tokyo since 1985.
They took a walk.
I am used to staying up late at night.
This pair of shoes doesn't fit me.
Why do you permit it?
There's a party tonight.
Do you think this is some kind of game?
Why don't you tell me what happened last night?
I really like it, too.
How do you want me to handle that?
Some days seem to just drag on and last forever.
Tom and Mary don't really have much in common.
I know all that.
What do you think?
I have so much to show you.
Maybe we should try to change that law.
That flower has a powerful smell.
She advised him to stop smoking.
It's been exciting and stimulating.
I can't believe this is all happening.
All you have to do is to meet her there.
What did Tom want to talk to Mary about?
Do your best in everything.
What's the world's highest mountain?
I understand you.
He raised his hand.
You are early.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
The parking lot is empty.
We listened to music yesterday.
I'm attaching three files.
What does this have to do with our current problems?
You won't be shot.
It was a warm day.
We haven't caught the thief yet.
I'm not angry!
Our cow doesn't give us any milk.
Hurry up, guys.
I know a lot about environmental problems.
I just don't remember.

This is nonsense.
This is also my first time.
I thought you'd be here.
They are looking for a house to live in.
She kept quiet.
You're fashionable.
Anything is OK with me.
He held out a helping hand to the poor.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
Is everything ready?
He delayed answering the letter.
I wouldn't have worried about that.
Tom fell asleep while reading.
You're such a cute boy.
I don't agree with you.
The news soon spread all over the village.
Are you seriously thinking about buying that old car?
They're dragging their heels.
I need your cooperation.
I saw what was happening.
I have come in response to your ad in the paper.
Please come again.
Are you still not convinced?

What were they doing here?
She plays the violin very well.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
I don't want to do anything that might be dangerous.
I don't know how I've offended you.
Let me ask you a stupid question.
It was last year.
We're still involved.
You're very stylish.
All the students of the university have access to the university library.
No one's prepared.
These are the rules.
We're all in this together.
Please add up the bill.
Tom doesn't owe anybody anything.
I don't think you really want to know.
Give me something cold to drink.
Help me if you can.
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
You are no longer welcome here.
It was a nice story.
That accident happened near his house.
You're pretty good.
Japan imports great quantities of crude oil.
Did you enjoy yourself?
Tom doesn't like to speak French.
This is outrageous.
Something's wrong here.
Tom liked what he saw.
I love being alone.
Wow! That's cheap!
It's the best we have.
No one I know buys CDs anymore.
I haven't gotten over my bad cold yet.
I demand satisfaction.
Why do you feel that way?
You were terrified, weren't you?
Do you get along with your boss?
Why don't I drive you?
He used a fake I.D.
It would be better if you didn't drink so much coffee late at night.

I know what you're probably thinking.
Is Tom right?

I hope everyone is happy.
This is where the fun begins.
Who broke this window?
I dried my face.
What languages do you know?
I never should've gotten divorced.
Can you tell me where it is?
He smiled and left.
They told me that I was overqualified for this job.
You don't have to apologize.
I have a surprise for you, sweetheart.
She rode a camel.
Tom was probably born in Boston.
I'm more than a friend.
I'd like to ask a question.
They accused me of having broken my promise.
I don't know how old Tom is.
None of these are good enough.
They were all good swimmers.
Get down.
Come help me.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
We must start at once.
It was the only way.
I want details.
We can't be sure of the total cost yet.
I know that I was wrong.
Tom bought Mary some expensive clothes.
I want to study abroad.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
Let me ask you a stupid question.
He wore a dark sweater.
We're here, too.
I owe you a lunch.
You're incredible.
First we'll eat, and then we'll go.
Did you order any food?
We don't have long.
I'm not completely naive.
I have been to London.
Who are you supposed to be?
He pushed the emergency button.

There's nothing that can stop us now.
It's too early to know.
The doctor informed his patient of the name of his disease.
I told you to call me.
Tom will need these.
Give it your best shot.
Where are our friends?
I owe it to my parents that I am so healthy.
I'll be back soon. I have to run to the post office.
I don't like the house he lives in.
I'll take you to the hospital.
Many young people are out of work in that country.
Let's discuss the matter right now.
I thought we'd be safe here.
I don't get what the author means there.
My father is quiet.
That's really awesome.
The traffic light turned green.
I asked him about the accident.
Science is very exciting.
These shoes fit my feet.
I wasn't going to buy anything.
That was nice.
Tom is in a state of shock.
How are we doing for time?
He has three sons.
I have a bicycle.
Tom ate what little food he had left.
She told me not to go there alone.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
Can the lawyer see me on Friday?
My friend helped me.
I keep saying that I'm innocent, but no one will listen.
This is out of control.
He is an old friend of mine.
You have to see it.
We are not to be disturbed.
He gazed at me.
You're looking very well.
Is there a man in your life?
Let's check the map.
It's close by.
Roll down the window.
I didn't even get a postcard.
Keep focused on your goals.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
Schedules are difficult to coordinate.
Best of luck to you.
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
If only she were to help, the job would be finished sooner.
War affects us all.
I revised my theory.
Where are the car keys?
I stayed at a nice hotel.
I guess my mind just wandered.
She had a pleasant dream.
I've made my decision.
Along with thousands of others, he fled the country.
You can go there.
You must be kidding!
What other choice did I have?
So far everything is all right.
Please find a solution to the problem.
Please lend me your car.
Do you think I want to die?
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
We have ample time to catch our train.
Everybody took a hostile attitude toward illegal aliens.
To my knowledge, she hasn't married yet.
Come in already.
Tom wrote an article for the school newspaper.
You talk too fast.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Could you please tell me your height and weight?
I bet that he'll accept your proposal.
I didn't realize you were here.
It was like something out of a nightmare.
I thought we talked about this already.
Finally, I have my own car.
Do you think her story is false?
We are doctors.
Are you happy with how you look?
Why don't you take a nap?
Honesty pays in the long run.
What did you do to it?
I've had enough.
This shouldn't be happening.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I still make a lot of mistakes.
I want to talk to you about this list.
Tom seemed to know the secret.
Tom introduced himself to everyone.
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
Please give me the book.
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
Two glasses of orange juice, please.
I did it.
Tom came here to ask us to help him.
Answer the question.
I often refer to the dictionary.
It's not going to take long.
It's my turn.
She threw herself into my arms.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Have you seen Tom's latest invention?
You're not tired, are you?
I've heard that you can kill werewolves by shooting them with silver bullets.
I'm finishing my homework.
I had to stop.
What's your first name?
You're not upset, are you?
It's not OK to smoke here.
God knows why.
Let's wait and see how things go.
A lot of fish perished.
I ate with my parents.

You look so pale.
Be more flexible.
My daughter is looking forward to Christmas.
You need to fix this.
I feel horrible.
He had a good look at the papers.
Tom and I like the same kind of music.
How could you be so careless?
Trade helps nations develop.
He is a harsh critic.
What's your home address?
I have had an inspiration.
He was scared you would shoot him.
I thought you were asleep.
My wish has finally come true.
Did you speak with him about your projects?
There must be a pattern.
Do you want a hand?
He's drunk.
I'm going off to Vancouver next week to see my sister.
The accident seemed to have something to do with the heavy snow.
I don't know why that happened.
Put your valuables in the safe.
The car broke down.
I'm the one who painted this picture.
Tom didn't get in until after 2:30 this morning.
Can you do it in one day?
I'm shorter than you.
I wonder why this is happening.
So, what do you say?
This car is very economical on gas.
I'm going to correct this.
She was asked to the party.
I want an apology.
Do you do that often?
I'll set you free.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
What did you do on your vacation?
I don't have the money.
You may still do it if you want to.
I want to keep on living with him.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
There's something going on here.
Do your homework right away.
Turn around, please.
Do you see what I mean?
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.
It may well be that you're right.
They burned.
Anything you say may be used against you.
It was hard for me to sell my guitar, but I needed the money.
I can't take that chance.
Don't you want to see the world?
Next week a family will move in.
I think Tom is ready.
She herself helped him because no one else would.
What is love?
Yesterday I was ill.
You are very dear to me.
He has his own room.
Help yourself to a drink.
Was this somebody else's idea?
I didn't even see you once last year.
They did a good job.
My uncle comes to see me from time to time.
To put it briefly, she turned down his proposal.
Let me write down the steps for you.
I disapprove of what you say.
They didn't see anything.
I don't live around here.
I ordered a glass of wine.
He was great.
We need to get going.
You need to be more careful from now on.
Do you know anyone in Australia?
Can you understand the meaning of this paragraph?
She took him to the lake.
We're looking for the truth.
You can do it.
We lost.
We're not entirely sure.
Are you home?
How would you describe me?
Call home!
Everyone who knew him admired him.
What a strange woman!
You know where to find me.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
Do you enjoy living like this?
He acted like a madman.
I'm glad I could help you.
I have no idea where we are.
Did he touch you?
What does that gentleman do for a living?
Start reading where you left off.
I'm doing it in spite of you.
Tom got the part.
Do you smell something?
White smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel.
I love you the best of all.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
I love the flowers you sent me.
How much do I owe you for the cup of coffee?
Tom made a serious error.
I'm not sure if that'll help.
That's not what you used to say.
He's three years older than her.
How long will you stay in Kyoto?
Those are mine.
I'll come without fail tomorrow morning.
The house is beautiful.
I'm really unhappy about this.
I cannot get in touch with him.
I have a dictionary.
It does seem like an excellent plan.
Stop shooting.
That's encouraging news.
Mary's my niece.
I received an invitation.
We worry about your future.
Tom finished his chores and then he did his homework.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
He will come in a moment.
I have no kids.
What will you be doing at this time tomorrow?
Corporations are competing to fill the vacuum.
He was conspicuous by his absence.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Will the government raise the consumption tax soon?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
That was our first encounter.
There wasn't enough.
Let's go outside and sit in the garden.
Don't tell her about it.
Tom, can you hear me?
Tom is tireless.
The tide is rising fast.
How can you say that?
Tell us exactly what happened.
Airplanes land at airports.
We're ready now.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.

Sheep eat grass.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Do you know CPR?
There is more water than is needed.
I don't know what I'm going to do next.
Is that for me?
The work is not finished yet.
Does that seem strange to you?
There've been times when doing that has caused us problems.
That's what's making me sick.
What's the best sleeping position?
I guess both of us were lying.
You're one of them, aren't you?
He is afraid to swim.
Can I be excused?
Both Tom and Mary blushed.
They eat fish on Fridays.
I'm offended.
I question your sincerity.
What exactly is that?
You didn't have to ask.
He deliberately ignored me when I passed him in the street.
That's why I wanted you to know.
I would've done it.
This data is incorrect.
I really must be going.
I want you to come back early.
Will I be able to find it?
That boy denies stealing the bicycle.
Why is that ridiculous?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I'll wait until tomorrow night.
Please come into the room.
He wiped the sweat from his forehead.
Tom is not playing by the rules.
I don't want to listen to you.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
There are many interesting people in the world.
I was heartbroken.
There is a river between Saitama and Chiba.
I would like a cup of coffee.
How did we do that?
I've been waiting for you for 5 hours.
You can borrow my car anytime.
He gets a kick out of reckless driving.
Her sister looks young.
Would you buy that?
I forgot to buy eggs.
What's happened to the money?
I never thought it would be this bad.
We're going to miss Tom.
Do you know the town where he lives?
I love your dress.
She became a woman.
What time will you have breakfast?
It happens more often than you would think.
Are you getting paid for this?
This was a lie.
He was hit by a car and died instantly.
Can Tom get a dog?
This book is not for sale.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
What illness do I have?
Tom didn't tell Mary everything.
Show me the way to the bus stop.
Mary has beautiful brown eyes.
I guess I just don't get it.
That seems like a lot.
Do you want to be left out?
You didn't come here alone, did you?
Do you mind if I help myself?
I would like to charter a yacht.
Everybody's in a hurry these days.
That's terrible.
I took the opportunity to visit the museum.
I can see the light.
I couldn't have done anything without Tom's help.
How did you get interested in art?
He is a typical Japanese.
There's no turning back now.
I saw a horse galloping toward me.
We know enough.
We often eat raw fish.
It was a stressful day.
Someone is watching Tom.
You didn't have to come so early.
He is a considerate father.
Water is leaking into my goggles. I don't think they fit right.
"This used to be such a friendly place." "Tell me about it."
Children often try to imitate their elders.
He has ten cows.
We're expecting lousy weather today.
If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.
I thought Tom was going to take us to see Mary.
Cut the power off.
I had a lot of help.
That was not my understanding.
I learned to drive a car and got a driver's license when I was eighteen.
Is that all clear?
May I eat a little of it?
Where are the others?
Tom doesn't think anybody else wants to come.
You can't be sure of that.
It's part of life.
We have to do our best.
There are a lot of fish in the pond.
She made him a new suit.
I'm used to this cold weather.
Tom needs you here.
According to legend, ghosts would appear in that forest, so people would not set foot there.
How is your weekend going so far?
Tom brought us each a gift.
That was a lot of fun.
I want you to talk.
He studies ten hours a day on average.
I had a snack before I went back to work.
Do you want to do this or not?
It's my fault, not yours.
I live three blocks away.
Tom disappeared.
You're fortunate.
We have considered your proposal, and we have decided that we are not able to reduce the price.
Strawberries are in season now.
What is the main purpose of your studying English?
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
He was satisfied with the result.
Please permit me to ask you some questions.
Nobody showed up today.
I hate it when my parents fight.
She has a daughter named Mary.
They live downstairs.
They questioned him.
Don't put me in the same class with them.
I'd like to know why my name was deleted from the list.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
I can't eat that much food by myself.
He shrank back in the face of danger.
Remember to mail this letter.
I found it difficult to solve the problem.
My bike is not anything like yours.
Let's give it a try.
Tom told me he was going to sell his house.
I'd like a hug.
I don't love you anymore.
Do you know anyone who was on that ship that sunk?
Do you like looking in the mirror?
Don't you recognize that man?
You know I don't dance.
A guide conducted the visitors round the museum.
Tom trusts Mary.
What do you do in Japan?
I want to be noticed.
I promise this will never happen again.
Tom thought he was going to die.
I had a toothache yesterday.
Why would anyone do that on purpose?
Who can say what will happen in the future?
What is the matter with you?
Out of my way!
Guess whose birthday it is today.
Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
The official dinner took place at the White House.
Tell me where to put these books.
I am certain that you have noble thoughts.
I assume you don't want this.
No one can help you.
Tell me. I'm all ears.
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
Attendance is free.
I was not pleased.
The paint hasn't dried yet.
He works as a ghost writer.
I won't be needing this.
The man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital.
Tom is often home.
That one is all yours.
I just don't buy it.
Tom's left.
I was sitting behind Tom.
How did you think it would go?
Don't expect too much.
We should take his youth into account.
You're no doctor.
What did you do with that?
You really should try this cake.
I had to make a decision.
I used to be a cop.
Leave it to me.
That's not what I was saying.
Do you want a lawyer?
I don't even want to think about what could happen.
It's a matter of principle.
She pressured him to quit his job.
No one seems to know what this is used for.
You gotta get more organized.
Can it wait another hour?
She went mad after the death of her son.
There are few houses around here.
I was just making sure.
I was caught in the rain and got wet.
You were terrified, weren't you?
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear and she nodded.
Let me go!
I'm not denying that.
The days are growing longer.
Tom is an octogenarian.
It won't make any difference.
How did Tom and Mary meet?
He will object to your going abroad.
Why did you do this to me?
You must hand in your homework by Thursday without fail.
Are you still up?
It's dangerous to jump off a moving train.
I don't think I could ever do this again.
It is very kind of you to send me such a nice present.
Try and stop me.
She persuaded him to do it even though she knew it wasn't a good idea.
They didn't choose me.
I've asked you this question before.
Their names were crossed off the list.
I wish I were in Paris now.
I have a lot of work still outstanding.
Let's take a look at the facts.
I like fresh air.
No wonder they have elected him chairman.
I knew they were coming.
I took off my hat and entered the church.
Well, I must be going.
Why were you in prison?
I'm comfortable.
You look good in black.
This room is very small, so it is impossible to put more furniture in it.
The senator was censured by the congressional ethics committee.
With your experience, any company would hire you right away.
I've never tried doing that.
Where's the exit?
I like all of them.
I guess I've gotten lazy.
I hate that more than anything.
Are you still playing the bassoon?
Tom won't visit Boston.
Watch the road.
Stuff happens.
Did anyone see you come in here?
A car hit Tom.
Something is wrong with this calculator.
I get asked that question a lot.
I'd like to build a new house.
Don't push it.
We need three more of these.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
I don't know why Tom didn't want us there.
We can't do this without some help.
I think we need to postpone the meeting.
I don't have medical training.
Are you going much farther?
Our team is gaining ground.
It was extremely funny.
Is it yours?
I have something of yours.
That pretty bird did nothing but sing day after day.
I found a job.
My phone has a caller ID that lets me screen my calls.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
Tell Tom that I'm angry.
I have a sharp pain here.
Why don't you love me?
Your wallet is on the television set.
Tom said he thought Mary was scared.
I'll have what he's having.
Whales are similar to fish in shape.
Tom never breaks promises.
Did I do all that?
He is inclined to get mad.
He held a pen in his hands.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I wanted to rent a bus.
It's up to you.
I don't want this news to be made public yet.
I'd like to be a teacher.
They grew closer.
There was a car accident near here, wasn't there?
Tom is older than Mary.
She advised me where to stay.
He worked through the night.
I know this is difficult for you.
They were pretty tired after having worked all day.
You have only to answer the first question.
Tom imitated Mary.
They're boring.
I'm not in a good mood either.
Every seat was full.
No one can help me.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
I don't know if I should tell you.
The girls won.
Are you ready for the trip?
Didn't that strike you as odd?
Is this all of them?
How could we have been so stupid?
The baby is asleep.
You probably just want to be alone.
Did you buy a return ticket?
Is there any life on Mars?
We used to be best friends.
It wasn't very fun.
How's that possible?
You didn't want me to starve, did you?
Do you have many friends?
She accepted his offer.
What is this place?
My customers never complain.
It happened a long time ago.
She's fond of taking pictures.
Tom isn't like us.
I am ready to follow you.
How am I supposed to dress?
I don't work late tomorrow night.
Parents need to set the rules around the house.
The man had something under his coat.
It's a dictionary.
I'm loyal.
Have they spotted you?
I expect Tom won't want to do that.
Staying at home is boring.
I'm too scared to say anything.
Did you win the trophy?
I have bad news for you.
You may as well leave at once.
They want peace.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Can you tell if it will rain tomorrow?
Do you feel lucky?
Your objection has been noted.
I wish you could come with us.

Do you know what day it is today?
When did you buy it?
We called off the wedding.
What sports do you like?
I was satisfied.
Take no chances.
I am no longer young, but I can still bite.
To tell the truth, she is my cousin.
We will take part in the marathon.
I really misjudged you.
The dog came running to me.
I should like to go for a swim.
Did you vote?
He is standing on the stage.
I figured I could count on you.
It's always a pleasure to see you.
To loosen a screw, turn it to the left.
I want to know what I'm buying.
She urged him to consider the request.
They called him a coward.
I figured something was up.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
I'm just worried about my weight.
I love my mother.
How do I know you didn't do it?
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my wife?
I don't like oatmeal cookies.
I've got things under control now.
He was born in a small town in Italy.
Exercise is to the body what thinking is to the brain.
Don't you have any change?
Tom just told his wife that he was leaving her.
It's as simple as that.
Where on earth did you meet him?
She backed out at the last moment.
I want to travel with you.
Take my advice!
My feelings for you haven't changed.
She may be proud of her daughter.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Do those insects sting?
Here, everybody feels respected and appreciated.
You should go.
You don't seem so smart.
I'm hanging a picture of my grandmother on the wall.
Don't you play tennis?
I'm still your friend.

Would you mind if I smoke?

The children were sliding on the ice.
Sorry, I didn't notice that.
I love him more than any of the other boys.
I was very disappointed.
There are holes in the floor.
He drew a straight line on the wall.
The war brought their research to an end.
I think they're lying.
I don't want that.
I'm happy to see you.
I felt responsible.
He is just an amateur.
Are you students at this school?
I can't ask you to take that sort of risk.
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
They seldom, if ever, speak in French.
Don't talk about my family.
I'm really sorry to hear that.
You get used to it.
They were yours.
Could you please lend me your dictionary?
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
I'm fussy.
We had to abandon our plan.
What he needs most is a good job.
That's the way I like it.
What do you learn English for?
I have to pay this bill today.
I made a bet that she would win the game.
It makes me feel dirty.
He handled the tool skillfully.
You're very brave.
We lost.
You are not entitled to attend the meeting.
Can I suggest something?
I remember the warmth of his arms.
There's no response.
The prince asked the little girl why she was crying.
That doesn't sound good.
I told him the big news.
How do you feel about the issue?
How did we not see it?
Let's sit down somewhere.
You are actresses.
I can't believe that actually happened.
Aren't you a little young for this position?
Sorry to interrupt you.
I'm not sure if I'm stupid or not.
Tom isn't able to come today.
I woke you up.
It's very kind of you.
I want to start over.
Tom says you're a genius.
I had business to take care of.
May I use your car today?
Tom doesn't seem to have any self-confidence.
The money has been put to good use.
Tom got in the car.
What do you know about this place?
At first, I thought he was your brother.
Stay home so that you can answer the phone.
Someone called on her yesterday.
Tom became more and more handsome as he grew older.
Did you talk about your hobby?
He lost his way in the woods.
Would you mind if I have a look?
He lost hope and killed himself by taking poison.
I got her to wash dishes.
I don't have time to read.
You're so wrong.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I want to kill you right now.
Tom still loves Mary.
He's writing a long letter.
Maybe it's true.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
What can I get you?
Are you ready to begin?
He's totally dependent on his parents.
Do you mind if I smoke?
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
Tom was Mary's only friend.
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
Do you think I did it?
He is stronger than ever.
I want to help Tom as much as I can.
I can't do two things at once.
I'll give it to you.
She was not interested in boys at all.
Did you know him well?
Come and have tea with me.
Whose side are you on?
That's absolute nonsense.
How's school?
Why are you so tired today?
My mother anticipates all my desires.
Why don't we just cancel the meeting?
You see what I mean?
I'm sorry about last night.
I'm not sure I want the job.
He looked up the word in his dictionary.
Show me how to do this.
He often goes to the library by car.
I knew this was a mistake.
Do you know why he skipped class today?
I turned on the radio.
You're in love.
I wish I knew what you're looking for.
She was bewitched by his smile.
It wasn't very fun.
Now it's your turn.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
I think Tom could be sick.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
She rubbed her eyes.
I'm glad you came over.
This is getting awkward.
She has a new man in her life.
I know that you feel helpless.
As we ate our meal, we talked about what we had done that day.
We should have gotten married.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
He is tired of watching television.
Do you eat lunch at your desk?
Come join us.
I feel cold. Would you shut the window, please?
Who's your favorite actor?
That was close.
These books are easier than those books.
Figure up how much it amounts to.
When were you born?
There isn't anybody else.
He was my best friend.
We did that.
He wanted to buy the book.
Why do you want to join the navy?
Telling lies is a very bad habit.
They said you were fired.
I take a shower every morning.
He could show his feeling with music instead of words.
I know how busy you've been.
Are you a registered voter?
"Will you show me your ticket?" "Yes, of course."
Thanks for bringing me here.
Let's clear this up right now.
He didn't look like a clever boy.
The soup's cold.
Sugar is bad for your teeth.
I was choked by smoke.
I spoke slowly so that they could understand me.
A lot of jobs are done by computers.
Is that bothering you?
It's a fast growing city.
We're surprised.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
The lights are on.
I heard the leaves rustling.
Never tell anyone.
I'd like to go to college.
Don't make the same mistake again.
Tom made breakfast.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
How does your wife feel about it?
I'm so tired!
If you want to be free, destroy your television set.
Tom doesn't think it'll rain tomorrow.
She put me in a delicate situation.
How strong he is!
You're very curious.
Are you referring to me?
I played tennis.
You hurt me.
That's one of them.
Wash your hands before you handle the food.
She was appointed chairperson.
I realize that there's a problem.
Am I clear?
Nothing is as important as peace.

I want everybody to go home.
An expensive car is a status symbol.
We need to go.
Eat everything.
Kiss me.
Taking a hot bath helps me take my mind off my worries.
She hit him again and again.
People with rheumatoid arthritis symptoms should be careful about what they eat.
What do you want me to do?
Raise your hand if you know the answer.
How much is this ring?
I didn't have enough space to fit my lunch in the bag.
Don't close the door.
I think I did well.
I don't know the password.
Focus on your breathing.
I come here as often as I can.
You're my kid's teacher.
I think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.
How come we're different?
Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school tomorrow morning.
Which Harry Potter book is your favorite?
I followed him.
You'll bounce back.
I just feel so lost.
You're just like your mother.
That's what terrifies me.
We heard tigers roaring in the distance.
He ratted us out.
After that incident, he never drank again.
He is lying on the sofa.
We're not getting any younger.
I like astrology.
Don't blame the victim.
Both of them said they would come.
This summer we'll go to the mountains and to the sea.
I'm not ready to do that.
We need to be more realistic than that.
Tom isn't as busy this week as he was last week.
Quite a few people came to the party.
Tom has until Monday to decide.
I'll pay.
You're not from around here, are you?
This is the culmination of years of work.
Put it in the closet.
By the way, did you have any spare time to go sightseeing while you were there?
I don't want you two talking about me.
How long have you been divorced?
Had he heard the news, he might have been shocked.
Tom certainly couldn't have succeeded without your help.
I cannot feel at home in such a hotel.
The spinning top skidded across the floor.
I will never forgive you.
Tom didn't tell Mary he couldn't speak French.
Tom has been spreading rumors about Mary.
I can't stand this stomachache.
He broke them.
After our first attack, the enemy fled.
I hate the way I look.
Tom put on a pair of latex gloves.
Your answer is wrong.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
I'm in trouble now.
Tom wants to marry Mary.
What a loss!
I'll keep it warm.
I'll live.
I said to myself, "I wonder what she means."
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
He beat the dog with a stick.
We have two kids.
How did you enjoy the concert?
A pine cone fell on Tom's head.
I want to go to Korea.
Show us the solution.
I never drink at home.
Parents should spend quality time with their children.
None of us knew the answer.
It's only worth three dollars.
How long has it been since you played with a yo-yo?
Tom won't let you down.
I decided to stay one more day.
The conference will take place in Tokyo.
You must be in love.
She just told me.
What's going on?
He's my best friend.
I should've seen this coming.
They are doctors.
Who wants another piece of cake?
The cat arched its back and stretched itself.
I am very tall.
I thought the little boy who was staring and pointing at the foreigner was very rude.
I'll check again.
We're the same.
Are we ready?
I know that I don't deserve you.
I like to finish what I start.
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
I don't know why he's so mad.
I've got this all under control.
He gets up early.
Is there anything to drink?
I'd rather not answer that question.
The Tigers lost the game, which was a surprise to us.
Tom told me not to say anything to you.
The capital of Ukraine is Kiev.
How come you know English so well?
I'm sure that is the truth.
Come here.
I pretended to work.
Don't blame me.
The supermarket is open.
He is anxious for her to come.
Are you doing all right?
That's the best I can do.
What are you complaining about?
We play football every Saturday.
The cat scared me.
I'm tired. It's been a long day.
Hang on tight.
The house stank.
You have no choice.
The patient requires constant care.
I've been sent to relieve you.

It is a very sad tale.
Foxes have few natural predators.
A monkey is climbing up a tall tree.
Tom bought a present for Mary.
I'm shorter than you.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
You always were a good cook.
Tom said he'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I came to Japan from China.
I hope to see you.
I couldn't do that either.
It's a very quiet room.
I object to her going there alone.
Do we have time for a cup of coffee?
I know why you did it.
I wasn't the only one who didn't know Tom.
I approve of your plan.
Should we get a table?
If I had had more money, I would have bought the pen.
I thought we could talk.
We remember.
Are you going there on business?
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
You're crafty.
Tom found out the truth.
You're very open.
Call off your dogs.
I think he likes you.
Clean your room.
Do you live here?
Typhoons hit Japan every year.
Tom snores loudly.
He fell asleep right away.
I can't give up.
No one was really surprised.
My father drives a very old car.
He seems quite happy.
I don't believe it!
Laughing is really good for you.
Does that mean you'll have to stay?
Tom certainly drives a nice car.
I'll lend it to you.
Hurry up, guys.
We all cried.
Industry as we know it today didn't exist in those days.
Do you have plans for dinner?
There wasn't anyone in the room.
I'm sorry I don't have my watch with me.
Tom kissed his cousin.
It was so hot I took my coat off.
I went to the park to play tennis.
Wait for your turn, please.
I'm here to see the manager.
Answer me right now.
The old woman is a doctor.

Tom never helps me.
Do you want any of these books?
How big is your yard?
I want you to help me clean it up.
Why don't you sing for us?
Tom walked back into the living room.
I know those girls.
Some of these young people have legs twice as long as mine.
I'm a night owl.
May I be of further service?

All of us stood up.
I thought I heard you.
He does it faster than me.
I wish they would stop fighting.
Dragons are imaginary animals.
I still don't have enough money to buy that.
You are very brave.
It's no use asking me for money.
Let's share the money.
They're thirty dollars each.
I thought you could help me.
You get out only what you put in.
Take whichever one you like.
You're the tallest person here.
Tom bought a house with a magnificent view of the sea.
He is my boss.

He was never to see his native land again.
He put a stamp on the letter.
Waiter, I'd like to order.
We are very similar.
I'm not crazy. You're the one who's crazy.
He stayed there some time.
Several yachts were sailing side by side far out at sea.
You're extroverted.
They're coming.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
I saved you.
You should look after the children from time to time.
He gave a deep sigh.
I'm still not sure I can do that.
You look tired.
This is worth studying.
Stand up, please.
Her house is on the other side of the bridge.
I could feel the sand between my toes.
I want to change the world.
He is working in AIDS research.
That's not what you want to do.
Maybe Tom won't go to Boston on this trip.
I forgot to tell you my phone number.
I agree completely with you on this point.
What does he say?
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
Many of our customers are in Australia.
I hope you have insurance.
We're at war.
Cats have pointed ears.
I don't agree with segregation of people by race.
That's all I remember.

Please turn off the light so that I can sleep.
He took a taxi to the station.
You look happy.
Tom took Monday off.
I have so many things I want you to know.
They can't fire you.
Don't make me go back there.
Where did you find this awful dog?
I'd like to see that ring, please.
Unless we find some way to drum up more business, bankruptcy will be our only option.
It is good to see you.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
That actually seems to be the problem.
He lives somewhere around here.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Sooner or later, we all are going to die.
I go shopping every other day.
Sing us a song.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom tells you.
I guess I haven't made myself clear.
You're a nervous wreck.
He still says that he did nothing wrong.
I bought you a gift.
Are you happy with that?
I'm glad to hear that.
That's not what you want to do.
I quite agree with you.
Hasn't the parcel arrived yet?
It won't be easy.
I really like your work.
They aren't going to help Tom.
I ate something earlier this evening that didn't agree with me.

Make it as spicy as you can.
This is so crazy.
He bought us some drinks.
Is there anything I can do?
Why didn't you say it like that?
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I have asked him.
I heard somebody talking.
We're on speaking terms.
Just trust me.
Which car is your father's?
Tom just got dumped.

It's not about them.
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
I cannot do without this dictionary.
We enjoyed playing football.

The shop was closed when I went there.
You're not too late.
Go grab a drink.

Tom was starting to feel a little uncomfortable.
I like rice more than I like bread.
He ran a great risk in the jungle.

Those who want to remain may do so.
I'm afraid of my boss.
He hit his head on the shelf.
I have made up my mind to achieve my goals in three years.
I should congratulate you.
Do you have something to say to me?

Is that all you're worried about?
I can run.
I knew how to keep a secret.
It hardly ever snows here in the winter.
I've got to speak to you.
Why do you have to be like that?
I share a room with Tom.
I'm stuffed.
We are looking forward to seeing you soon.
From personal experience, I know that any encounter with him will leave a bad taste in your mouth.

I can't stand this pain any more.
We should obey the rules.
Thanks for coming.

A stranger came into the building.
My bag was stolen.
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
This is my daughter's school.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I hope not.
You're wasting your time.
Is that all clear?
How did you get over the difficulty?
He's shy, and never speaks unless spoken to. You have to talk to him.
I left you a couple messages.
She is among those unaccounted for.
I feel like going to the movies, but I still have to do my homework.

Is this what you were looking for?
Tell him to wait.
Brush your teeth.
I'll go get the pizza.
She knew the story already.
Tom kidnapped Mary.
I should've called.
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

Why did you become a police officer?
I've gotten used to living alone.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You're first.

Will you introduce me to her?
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
She also likes chocolate.
I will never forget seeing you.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
"Does Tom love you?" "I think so."
What does he see in her?
We'll manage.
I don't like your smile.
I'll be praying for you.
No one is asking you.
You are more stupid than I thought.
Tom's rather busy just now.
Was that an insult?
I don't like her.
Windy this morning, isn't it?
You were Tom's only friend.
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
I suggest you cooperate.
Let's see what we're dealing with.
What's going on in here?
We won't have much time.
I tried my best, but I still lost the race.
I don't want you to do that, Tom.
What other option is there?
It is time you told her the truth.
Why are you even here?
The children were sleeping when their grandparents called them.
Got it!
Why are you doing this to me?
Tom says he eats more when he's sad.
Tom saw Mary break the window.
Will you show me the book?

Can you count to ten in Chinese?

Tom is handsome.
I don't think this is a good time to talk to Tom.
I know you are rich.
She was asked to convince him to paint the house.
I suggest that you talk to Tom.

You've underestimated Tom.
She guessed right.
I hate parties.
How fast can you do it?
Do you have your passport?
Everything will work out on schedule.
We're not lost.
I couldn't lie to you.
I didn't think you'd believe me.
Give me a break.

How will I pay my debts now?
Please have a seat.
They are artists.
Guess what I did last night.

I didn't see anybody following us.
To tell the truth, I felt lonely.
He kept on crying.
How do you explain all this?
He was very fun.

I'm being paid to do this.
We hope to meet you again.

Your car has a broken taillight.
We don't have the money.
So what are you talking about?
Don't burn yourself.
Why doesn't anybody help you?

She is a real beauty.
Is it done?
How is the weather?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Don't I have some say in this?
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
Tom was wearing a baseball cap.
It certainly feels like it's going to rain.

A lot has happened.
His wife is worn out after looking after the children.
We have no other option.
Tom is an orphan.
I would like to meet you.
Quit complaining.
Do you hear me?
I really appreciate this.
Why don't you start?
If she had told me the truth, I wouldn't be angry.
I want to be heard.
I didn't move.
How many more forks do you need?
I thought Tom had a soccer game tonight.
Tom looked at his reflection in the mirror.
They seem to be enjoying themselves.
I can't believe you just did that.
I'm very hungry.
Look what I did.
Why did you ask Tom to do that when you knew he couldn't do it?
He has one dog and six cats.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I should be happy.
He's handsome and charming.
I'll stay out of your way.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't help but notice all the beautiful women on the beach.
He didn't have time to read.
Don't take this the wrong way.
You're a jolly good feller.
I just got fired.
He refused to take the bribe.
You should eat more.
The computer is to her left.
You're kidding!
He's kind of cute, isn't he?
Which is your luggage?
Tom isn't very nice to Mary.
He denied having said such a thing.
I like your techno dance moves.
When did they build that?
She recovered from her long illness.
That makes everything simpler.
Go away.
What is your address?
She came near to me.
She is not only intelligent but beautiful.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
He saved us all.
I no longer live in Boston.
He is a handsome young man.
I just want to be alone.
I have some things in the hotel safe.
Let's do it!
You tried to stop Tom from doing that, didn't you?
Are you tired of living?
Shape up or ship out!
Even though she was busy, she came to see me.
You're courteous.
Do you think Tom is still up?
She set up an association to help blind people.
Will I be able to find it?
I had a drink or two before you came.
I want you both to get them.
The old woman got hurt when she fell.
I know I should've stayed in Boston.
There are several possible explanations.
Finish your homework before you go to bed.
What's your favorite sport?
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
Is anything missing?
You think I did it, don't you?
You're a little liar.
Tom's grandfather and Mary's grandfather fought together in World War II.
Do you have any news at all?
Thanks a heap.
I must go.
We are a family of four.
I know you can see it.
Let me remind you of something.
We must carry out that plan.
I leave this afternoon.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
I used to like folk music.
I am going to bed.
Tom never told me he was married.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
The more I think about it, the less I understand it.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
This is your fate.
I wish I had eaten lunch before I came here.
Peace has returned after three years of war.
Tom didn't give me back my money.
That can't be good for you.
He isn't coming, either.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
I'd like some time alone, please.
Tom was afraid to cross the road.
You're very nice.
He is clumsy with his hands.
Show me the photos, please.
Tom was sure of it.
I like it that way.
You're stubborn.
Your feet are dirty.
No one followed me.
The car has been acting strangely.
I'm not ready to do that.
She asked him to marry her.
Don't just take my word for it.
I've never stopped loving you.
We waste a lot of time.
I have no time for games.
My father isn't home.
I'm against the bill.
Don't tell anyone this.
How many boys are in this class?
We're all dying.
I'm going.
I don't know how to contact you.
I didn't ask you to do that.
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
Our company has a long, long history.
What are you waiting for?
They invited them to dinner.
Nobody was interested.
My bicycle has a flat tire.
I can't wait to go.
I can't let you.
I'm thirsty. Can I have a glass of water?
It doesn't have to be like this.
What was his motive for doing it?
He wants to come.
The drawer won't open.
Tom cooks for us.
Everyone quieted down.
They advertised that they had a house for sale.
She will be a famous artist in the future.
My internet connection is slow.
I need some sugar.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
He invited me to a party.
You're all fired.
You've turned up at the right moment.
Please show me your notebook.
I reserved my hotel room three weeks in advance.
Tom also speaks French.
I've got to get back home by midnight.
How long will the operation take?
That voice sounds familiar.
Hold your breath, please.
I want more.
To my surprise, he had a beautiful voice.
Don't you want to talk to Tom about it?
That's probably going to fall.
Please be serious.
This text is aimed at beginners.
Lie still.
I think it's time for me to buy a new camera.
What's the spelling of your family name?
How does this work?
The U.S. thinks it is getting the short end of the stick.
I have no idea why it is so.
It is not easy to understand why you want to leave.
Have you seen all these movies?
Get some sleep, okay?
I live here alone.
What happens if I press this button?
She looked all around.
I can't believe he kissed you.
We have no options but to continue.
French is pretty hard, isn't it?
He never cared much for me.
He's too old for me.
Tom has an apartment in Boston.
Within hours, the world knew the news.
I come here as often as I can.
May I show you something?
Do I have to pay you?
Does it work?
I have absolute trust in you.
Parents should monitor their children's whereabouts.
It's a misunderstanding.
I'll call back as soon as I can.
He walked along the shore.
I hope Tom is right.
He acknowledged his faults.
I think you already have enough money to buy what you need.
I love both cats and dogs.
I don't like that sentence.
He likes this guitar.
Tom's parents are missing.
I caught him by the arm.
You're tough.
How long do dreams last?
Did you have any luck?
Tom isn't a good singer.
I don't have long.
They say that he knows the secret.
I think it's time for me to stop allowing her to always have her own way.
Languages aren't his forte.
You don't have a clue.
I don't have time for that.
Money opens all doors.
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
The last train has already gone.
Get on the bus.
Everyone's standing.
Those who know him speak well of him.
How many times have you done that?
I shouldn't have to tell you to do your homework.
She is never late for school.
You're on to something.
I hope all your dreams come true.
These days few people suffer from tuberculosis.
I love the taste of mushrooms.
We aren't Canadians.
Is it time?
I think Tom knows more than he's admitting.
I thought you had all the answers.
Could you tell me how to get to Park Street?
She raised her hands.
The boy who lives next door often comes home late.
You know what they can do, don't you?
You can't do both at the same time.
The moment she heard the news of her son's death, she burst into tears.
Get off my back!
We did have fun together, didn't we?
We have different points of view.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
If you have something to say, say it to my face.
I guess we should go get something to eat.
He has already begun.
We argued politics.
Why would you want to do something like that?
They're doing it right.
Tom doesn't like living alone.
I like sweets.
Sometimes water becomes a precious commodity.
We're working on a limited budget.
I've given this a great deal of thought.
Stop being so nice to me.
This lid is so tight I can't open it.
There isn't much wind today.
He has no conscience.
When did you finish writing the letter?
The train arrived on time.
Advertising sells products over the air.
You really are nuts.
I wonder what's in the box.
I didn't think we'd be able to get in.
He betrayed my confidence.
Push the door open.
Tom didn't respond right away.
I could have done it without your help.
I have enough money to buy it.
We need to get rid of Tom.
I was so humiliated.
The baby was shaking the rattle.
Vacation's already over.
No sooner had he said it than he was sorry.
My eyes are sore.
That wasn't very nice.
I refuse to be taken in by her guile.
Is there anything else you'd like?
I would like some hot tea, please.
Why don't we talk in your office?
It's not enough.
You're back again.
I can't see well.
Who is this guy?
You're preaching to the choir.
You have no right to be here.
Shall we go and eat?
My sister asked me to teach her how to ski.
She was unconscious of her mistake.
I hope we didn't wake you.
You're famous.
What were you two doing?
Did you say yes?
They are looking to you for help.
My pen is old. I want a new one.
You aren't a spy, are you?
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
I'm losing.
Don't miss this amazing opportunity.
We don't have any proof.
They made her go.
That dress matches her red hair.
I'm not persuaded.
I believe we can get that done.
The last part of the trip was across the desert.
That was amazing.
I paid him the money last week.
That's hers.
Electronic components can be cleaned using pure isopropyl alcohol.
Honestly, I don't think you have what it takes to become a teacher.

I'm eating lunch.
The number is 932-8647, but I don't know the area code.
I have so many clothes I don't know what to wear tomorrow.
Don't drink the tap water.
I wonder whether Tom will go to Boston or Chicago next summer.
Get on with it.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
People look at things differently depending on whether they are rich or poor.
Tom threatened Mary.
I hurried in order not to be late for school.
Hop in.
I went to the airport to meet my father.
I think you should open an account here.
Is it fatal?
He caught a cold.
Is this your idea of a good time?
The answer was yes.
You sound tired.
I'm not about to ask him.
My husband is at work.
Give me your watch.
You three are very lucky.
Be nicer to your brother.
I'd like to speak with Tom in private.
Tell me what you saw.
A dog suddenly jumped at me.
It snowed hard yesterday.
These are fresh.
What were you doing that moment?
I love this game.
Did you have fun last night?
Do you want to see my translations?
I now view life differently than I used to.
What would you like to do while you're here?
You don't have to get up so early.
He can only pay twenty dollars at most.
He shook hands with the mayor.
We had less snow this winter than we had expected.
He picked up a stone.
You're an idiot.
Leave this to me.
I'm coming to help you.
I'm not really worried about that.
They said no.
I wore a coat so I wouldn't catch a cold.
He acts like he knows everything.
He was going to leave the house when she came.
Actually, I don't like the way your hair is done.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've got a small problem.
Are you sure that's necessary?
He wasn't earning a large salary when he retired.
I can't finish the job in such a short time.
She made him rich.
I didn't write that letter.
Our team can win.
I'm not scared of dying.
I don't know what's happened.
I'm intrigued.
He learned to swim.
Everybody's having a good time.
I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.
Our work never ends.
What do you do for a living?
English is spoken in America.
Oh, didn't I mention it?
It is essential that every child have the same educational opportunities.
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again.
Is this a challenge?
I had a lot of gumption when I was young, but now it seems to have all petered out.
It is probable that she will come.
It's the biggest house in the neighborhood.
You should be more careful.
Go look for it.
I think we should concentrate on other things.
You have a decision to make.
People used to travel on foot.
Don't give up halfway.
You need a reality check.
Will you go with us?
We're not friends.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
He made up his mind to go there.
They both snickered.
Stop being so curious.
I need that.
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
Many stores offer discounts in the month of August.
Are you the group leader?
I don't want to discuss that with Tom.
That's something that happens quite often.
Had it not been for his aid, I could not have finished the work.
She can't ride a bicycle.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
He is my brother, not my father.
He blew out the candles on the cake.
The baby is crawling.
I do not mind what people say.
That sounded like a gunshot.
Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.
I shouldn't have gotten up so early.
I've told you over and over again not to do that.
I shouldn't have gone there.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've got a small problem.
Tom didn't know what to believe.
You're a jolly good feller.
He made up a pretext for a fight with me.
You have more energy than I do.
I can't blame you.
None of you have any idea what I've been through.
Reading books is important.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
We're changing it.
Do you like cheeseburgers?
Will you let me know when he comes?
I'll buy a new one.
Look, I'm not interested.
I'd like to try this on. Where are the fitting rooms?
When you wake up tomorrow morning, you will find a wonderful thing.
She borrowed the book from him many years ago and hasn't yet returned it.

I never believed it.
I'll go back to Boston.
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
Is there something you want to ask?
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I can't believe you really want to do that.
The same holds true for Germany.
I run a small business.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.

Don't fail to come here by five.
I always take a bath in the morning.
She takes private piano lessons.
She made a bet with him.
I want you to talk to me.
Tom's married.
Who's coming for dinner?
I never saw him again.
Did you have fun tonight?
I'm not yet accustomed to this cold weather.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
I will have it uploaded by Friday.
Why didn't you call me last night?
I think you deserve more than this.
I didn't have to wait long.
Can you stand the summer heat in Nagoya?
Tom is afraid of doctors.
He asked for more money.
Can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant?
I'm going to teach you some karate.
Jazz fusion is a combination of rock and jazz.
No one can see.
She didn't even try to do the right thing.
Tom ate dinner in the dark.
You're temperamental.
I found somebody.
Why don't we take a taxi?
I don't feel like playing either.
He is the only American to have swum the English Channel.
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation?
At first, they didn't believe him.
You're creative.
It would cost twice as much as that.
Tom killed a man.
It's still mine.

Why are you so busy today?
He failed, due to lack of money.
Don't you know how dangerous it is to go swimming by yourself?
I never worry.
You've been had.

I'm studying very hard.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
Do you understand what I mean?
Tell me which of the two cameras is the better one.
I found no money left in my pocket.
I barely knew Tom.
I'm glad to be here.
Paparazzi thronged both sides of the red carpet.
Why did I trust you?
I'm three blocks away.
Happy Valentine's Day.
I like to dream.
I don't really see what the problem is.
The costs are too high.
I thought you were older than me.
Don't forget to call me.
I came to talk about Tom.
I want to do what's best for both of us.
I just want to be loved.
Why would I need to do that?
The vase was broken to pieces.
This news is official.
It's almost unbreakable.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
We apologize for any inconvenience.
You're fun.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
Please let me know when dinner's ready.
They kissed each other.
I'll tell you a secret.
Tom filled out the application form.
He's their only child.
Where was I?
It has been her dream to be a university professor.
I can't wait to die.
How's it going to happen?
Are you looking for something?
I'd like to have dinner with you sometime.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
How nice!
Are you sure you're not tired?
See what happens when you tell the truth?
Do you want to know why I helped?
I messed up.
My father might be at home now.
Tom died about a year ago.
It turned out that I was right.
I must brush up my English.
You will not be able to catch the train.
What did they hit you with?
Do whatever you like.
I have already had my breakfast.
Don't tell anyone about this.
He's incredibly talented.
Would you be willing to help?
This grocery store only sells organic food.
World War I broke out in 1914.

Will you help them?

I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
My life is empty without him.
Variety is the spice of life.
I don't know what I did wrong.
Why are you so secretive?
She is beginning to play the piano.
It's a difficult language.
Now isn't a very good time.
The recent frequency of earthquakes makes us nervous.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
This is very cheap.
They said no.
I wish you had told me that.
I tuck my children into bed every night.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
I have just read this book.
I can't continue to ignore the problem.
We forgot to lock the door.
Are you dating anybody?
What did you want to talk to me about?
What's your favorite holiday?
What's wrong with my idea?
I just got out of a relationship.
I think Tom said he was from Boston.
She smiled at him uneasily.
He wore a light blue tie.
There goes our bus.
I couldn't have solved this case without you.
I'm not the guy you want making this decision.
I couldn't hear what was being said.
I don't see Tom as often as I'd like.
I only quit because you asked me to.
The investigation is under way.
He held her tightly.
It was rather funny.
Are you jealous?
It's really hot there.
There is an urgent need for people to help clean up the environment.
You don't have to apologize.
Aren't you too young to smoke?
I do not think that he will come.
This will be one of the best memories of my life.
I'm glad you decided to come.
Tom must be proud.
Why do you like sports so much?
You're very wise.
One of the bulls pushed the fence down.
What's your hobby?
I thought you were a Canadian.
I forgot my pencil.
He can't be older than me.
I hate your guts.
Is there a telephone anywhere?
There were no survivors.
Don't state the obvious.
I know you feel lonely.
I said I was busy.
Can I leave a message?
Corporations are not people.
I remember this music.
Is that your cat?
I'm glad to see you're happy.
I couldn't make out what he wanted to say.
This is extortion.
Are you up?
Today's housewives do nothing but complain of high prices.
I was fired last week.
I may not know a lot, but I do know that Tom doesn't know what he's talking about.
I pulled as hard as I could.
The paper didn't carry the story.
I was deceived by her appearance.
He came to see me in a different way.
I can't believe I'm stuck here in this room with you.
He soon grows tired of a thing regardless of how much he liked it to begin with.
If he really doesn't want to go, he shouldn't have to.
The train is ten minutes late today.
You were mine.
I can't kiss you now.
It was your idea.
Don't blame the messenger.
Do you like studying?
Do you know anyone who can speak French?
I had to get back home.
Strive to be happy.
The cat was licking its paws.
A ball is floating down the river.
I should have listened more carefully.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
Is this seat vacant?
Is Tom well?
What's your problem?
What's this smell?
I'm just worried about my weight.
Please hurry up!
I meant to have that done by now.
May all your dreams come true!
Have you ever heard someone speaking in French?
How did you happen to see them doing it?
I have to take my medicine every six hours.
The athletic meet was postponed due to rain.
That job wasn't very interesting. However, the pay was good.
Tom wasn't a suspect.
Do you want anything to eat?
Come to think of it, I really need a cellphone.
His lectures are very long.
We're in control.
I want you gone by sunrise.
What did you get?
I am forever in your debt.
I'm homesick.
We wish him all the best of luck in his future endeavors.
This knife was very useful to me.
Somebody answered.
She never lies.
You know this is illegal, don't you?
Feel this.
I think you're being a little too careful.
The decision has already been made.
Do I look fat?
Stay down.
I didn't think anybody was coming.
We don't speak French at home.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
Someone came.
They'll be back soon.
It's a very stressful job.
I'm glad no one got hurt.
The enemy dropped many bombs on the factory.
Do Japanese people eat sushi every day?
They're not a threat.
Don't tell my wife.
Let him talk.
Banks open at nine o'clock.
No one wanted to babysit Tom.
You can always count on me.
What's the weather like?
Whose guitar is this?
I may have made a mistake.
Give it to them.
You should have seen him.
I don't really want to be all by myself.
You are responsible for the result.
Don't laugh at him for making a mistake.
I've never been better.
I don't know how many minutes we've got.
Policemen aren't permitted to drink on duty.
I ran into a friend on the bus.
Everyone tried to sell their stocks.
I have a business meeting.
He began his meal by drinking half a glass of ale.
He has gone to Osaka on urgent business.
It isn't safe for us to remain in this area.
I figured you weren't coming.
I never thought it would end like this.
What time did you close the store?
The results were spectacular.
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
You can't dance, can you?
Who broke the window?
We're speechless.
I left Tom three messages.
Isn't it infuriating?
I don't think this is a good idea.
I've never been to New York, and my sister hasn't, either.
Tom is tall, but not as tall as I am.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
We'll have to make some tough choices.
You're getting closer.
He has been living in Ankara since 2006.
I am proud to be a part of this project.
He is afraid of making mistakes.
He's very ill.
I have to make another call.
They are Christians.
Do you want to get drunk?
This is my dream job.
My tailor is rich.
I don't work there anymore.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
I'll go look.
They basked in the sun.
This is what you're supposed to do.
Let's leave the matter as it is for the present.
He gets tough at times.
He has curly hair.
Most Americans agreed with President Wilson.
This isn't too hard for you, is it?
His story moved her to tears.
I really can't understand modern sculpture.
Have another.
Please smile.
There are beautiful flowers here and there in the garden.
My father has been dead for ten years.
He doesn't drink anymore.
He squinted.
Don't put it on my desk.
It's not that big of a deal.
Why did you choose that particular subject?
I thought I was your best friend.
I let my guard down momentarily.
You could've been hurt.
I have a lot of questions.
Is Tom living in Boston?
You have got to be kidding me.
His name is mud.
That woman has wrongly accused me.
They formed a circle.
Be ruthless.
I shouldn't drink.
Tom died of cancer.
I didn't realize you were awake.
The town was destroyed by the flood after the storm.
We live in an apartment.
He lived in Spain, I think.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
He didn't tell me everything.
He's new in town.
Keep out.
I promise you I'll look after you.
Don't be scared.
I thought you were working.
We have to get away from here.
I feel young.
Don't worry about it.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
Many atrocities were committed during the war.
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
Maybe it was a cat.
I didn't win.
Could you read this for me?
Would you carry this up to the second floor for me?
How high can you jump?
She was ill for a long time.
Tom gets up early in the morning.
I want to share this with my grandchildren one day.
I think he's a great writer.
My father made me a nice lunch.
Do you know Latin?
Will you sing some English songs for us?
I don't really feel sick.
Of course, I feel guilty.
Wolves won't usually attack people.
You don't fall in love with somebody because he's perfect.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
What are you saying?
Don't tell me what I know.
Three quarters of the country's inhabitants live below the official poverty level.
Tom almost caught Mary.
Would you care for more coffee?
This chair is broken.
Do you like to live in the country?
I hope you enjoyed your trip.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
I have enough money to buy a car.
Don't worry. This won't happen again.
Is anyone going to eat that?
This place hasn't changed much.
You're very busy.
I need medical help.
I'm not a saint.
I'll be with you as soon as I finish this job.
What can I tell you?
I'm not good enough for you.
I didn't know you had a brother.
I'm just doing my job.
Are they cops?
Tell Tom he has to do everything Mary asks him to do.
I'm glad you see it that way.
My waist size has recently increased. I guess it's middle-age spread.
I'd never seen Tom cry before.
Who is on the train?
She has a large room all to herself.
I just couldn't do it anymore.
I had second thoughts.
Tom is hiding behind the couch.
Help Tom.
Did you invite him?
I had to keep my secret.
Tom likes to climb the trees.
You're an interesting girl.
This should be more than enough.
I have a wife and kids.
She can't control her children.
They're happy.
I hate the guy who lives next door.
The teacher got well again.
Whose bicycle is this?
I want to hear you play the piano.
The roof was damaged by the storm.
My brother gave me a charming baby doll.
I did my best.
The tall man looked at Tom and smiled.
I plan on skipping lunch.
I was sympathetic.
She told him that she didn't love him.
We can not learn Japanese without learning Kanji.
I thought you'd got lost.
We did nothing wrong. It was only a kiss.
He wiped the sweat from his brow.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
I want to remember all of this.
Do you agree to our proposal?
I designed it.
I'll do whatever you want.
At last, you've hit the nail on the head!
I'm falling.
I'd like to visit England someday.
My sister has a piano.
How do you stand this heat?
You let me down.
He went there instead of his father.
Are you on dope?
I saw some monkeys climbing the tree.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I ate on the bus.
She rides her bike to school.
Do I annoy you?
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
Have you decided already?
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
We need to get out of here.
She is playing with a doll.
He helped me carry the chair.
She had a basket full of apples.
Why did you ditch me?
Who is your favorite player?
You will not be able to catch the train.
I was as surprised as you.
He studied hard in order to get into college.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
We had a minor disagreement.
That child may have been kidnapped on his way home.
I have to admit that you're right.
I want to play chess with Tom.
Be merciful.
I don't plan on being a waiter all my life.
Tom tripped over something.
Tom isn't a lazy child.
Do you have a book written in English?
Will you glance through this report?
I want him to leave.
She advised him to cut down on smoking, but he didn't think that he could.
I hope everybody is on our side.
He is tall and handsome.
He counts fast.
We're punctual.
I am sure I can get in touch with him by telephone.
I work here.
I haven't washed my hair.
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
You should always knock before entering Tom's room.
This sword has a strange history.
Tom teaches his friends French.
She asked him for some money.
I will see to it that everything is ready in time.
Elephants are the world's largest land animals.
Who invented the piano?
What prompted you to move out?
Our ownership in the company is 60%.
You're free to go.
I can't take my glasses off.
Save me a seat.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
I never get to see you anymore.
What kind of woman do you think I am?
Tom hates to lose.
Do you like oysters?
It's a question of taste.
Maybe I should go.
That soon changed.
Can I tell you something very personal?
Several politicians exerted strong pressure on the committee.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.
The government is promoting the use of domestically made products.
Tom told me you needed some money.
It's my problem.
The rain prevented him from coming here.
Is there somebody you want to call?
Can you think of any better way to do this?
Do you really think Tom is happy?
The last thing I want to do is cause you any more pain.
May I have your signature here, please?
Would you mind waiting a minute?
This will never happen again, I swear to you.
I'm sorry that I didn't email you sooner.
Tom never breaks promises.
Does that mean you won't come?
The girl cried out for help.
Tom is a very influential man.
I want to spend time with you.
Wake Tom up.
It's raining again!

Leave us.
Tom is competent, but Mary isn't.
Tom put on some clothes.
You're acting like a child.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.

He tried it over and over again.
Why do you need a doctor?
Will he ever forgive me?
It's lunch time.

The man caught the girl by the wrist.
I called you.
You were fantastic.

He opened the door.
I only want to help you.

We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.

I'm going to need your help on this.
The tree was struck by lightning.
Who's taking responsibility for this?
Is it a deer?
You're right, Tom.

You have a very pretty name.
I'm not quite done here.

He caught a large trout.
There's something we have to do.

I want to do it myself.
I'd like to hear you sing your new song.
Tom and Mary decided to leave.
Tom took a day off.
He is a sharp-shooter.
The student made an irrelevant remark.
Hot, dry areas will become hotter and drier.
What are you saving up for?
Don't be naive.
Tom should come right away.
I was really young when I met you.
What condition is the building in?
Could you call me back later?
We have enough time to catch the train.

I saw Tom and Mary leave together.
I can't stand kids.
That's so inappropriate.
I don't feel like smoking today.
I appreciate what he did for me.
Whose handbag is this?
It is up to you to see to it that such a thing doesn't happen.
I'm the oldest.
The weather is turning nasty.
I'm wealthy.
You're very talented.

It's a huge responsibility.
Don't try to do two things at a time.
I'd like to buy this doll.
I have some shopping to do.
They painted their house bright yellow.

I could not help but state my opinion.

If I'm not mistaken, I think we took a wrong turn back there.
Don't play ball in this room.
I'll never forgive you as long as I live.
I read the book from beginning to end.
If the phone rings again, I plan to ignore it.

Are you sure you saw someone on the bridge?
There are a lot of things I want to ask you.
He is now almost as tall as his father is.
Beat the eggs.
This is a pencil.
He was seized with fear.
Don't make me do it.
Stay with us.
I fought back.
Try again.
I couldn't tell you why.
Where should we do that?
Look at Tom's shoes.
Let's see what you have there.
I need to go out for a while.
That was pathetic.
You'll have a rough time.
Many friends came to see me off.
I'm not sure why they asked me that.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.

You've never been happy.
What's Tom afraid of?
This is how I made it.
Is this one of your creations?
I've finally made a decision.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
It's not fair to attribute your failure to your parents.
Maybe he likes you, too.
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.
Could you tie it with a ribbon?
Let me go!
I tried doing that.
She's the most beautiful woman.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
I was there a year ago.
We're here to help.
He asked me some questions about the math test.
They got to be good friends.
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
I'll meet you right after school.
Thank you just the same.
What do you consider your greatest achievement?

You are absolutely right.
It looks as if it is going to rain.
If we're going to do this, let's do it right.
I gave you fair warning.
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
She was watching TV when I came home.
The doctor examined over fifty patients that day.
Tea with lemon for me, please.
How did you accomplish this?

A merchant is a person who buys and sells goods.
He decided not to go.
He speaks French fluently.
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
I already gave it to Tom.
I'm not a saint.
Tom gives us what we need.
There's got to be a way.
His incompetence began to irritate everyone.
Would you like a sandwich?
I don't want Tom to see that.
She's by far the tallest girl.
Anything else?
Maybe Tom is in love.
They water the fruit trees.
Is there anywhere you want to go?
English is spoken in many countries.
Tom and Mary are getting married in three months.
Pershing's forces were not sent directly into battle.
You're precise.

I want your opinion.
Let's not get discouraged.
Remain seated, please.

My daughter has braces.
These flowers have a unique smell.
He married my cousin.
What seems to be the problem here?
It's rare to find big yards in Japan.
He had no luck in finding work.
Would you consider taking care of my children next Saturday?
We've all read that one.
You should keep clear of that side of town.
Do you still love him?
Life isn't all roses and sunshine.
From now on, there is no reason to worry any more.
I paid the bill.
I don't know if we're going to be able to make it to Boston for Christmas.
I suppose that's OK.
I have some numbness in my left hand.
I thought you were older than me.
She advised him to stop working so much.
She visited her husband in prison.
How did you get to know about her?
Do you recycle?

She spent all afternoon cooking.
Tell them that they're wrong.
Where is the nearest store?
He wants you to come home.
He apologized to her for being late.
I highly doubt Tom wants to see you.
Do you know where my recipe book is?
I'm in bed.
We usually walk to school.
I'm a purist.
Can you help me with the washing up?
Can we prove it?
I will call you tomorrow afternoon.
She can speak English very well.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
I can't do it right away.
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
You two had a fight today, didn't you?
Who has taken my handbag?
The motor does not function properly.
Let's throw it away and start over with a clean slate.
Thirty isn't that old.
We're not happy.
That was a big surprise.
I never wear a hat.
Why didn't you follow my advice?
Your room is very big.
Don't even get me started.
Tom isn't my enemy.
Recently I moved to another apartment.
Tom's sweating.
My sister is younger than me.
I'll go to the dentist tomorrow.
I've never made a lot of money.
Let’s go now. Otherwise, we'll be late.
I wanted to see what would happen.
I made an appointment to see the doctor at four o'clock.
I want to teach history when I grow up.
They are not very different from anybody else.
I'll introduce you to a nice girl.
It's a curse.
I thought it might be you.
Do you have an appointment?
I think we'd better be going.
We did that yesterday.
It takes time to speak a foreign language well.
As far as I know, Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
They understood that.
You're the best.
Where did you find the key?
Would you please autograph this book?
You need to stop complaining all the time about things that can't be changed.
The hours are terrible.
Tom loves fishing.

You're the one who trained me.
This is the only tie I have.
I am an optimist by nature.
Let's end this debate.
I can't believe I used to watch this show.
Would you happen to know what this is?
I think we'd better help Tom.
You may be able to pass unnoticed in a city, but in a village that's not possible.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
I expect you all to do your best.
Get me out of here.
The answer is no.
I have to look after this cat.
Tom is quite cooperative.
Why didn't you do that?
Will you join us?
Who was the book written by?
A fallen tree obstructed the road.
Do ghosts really exist?
There was a church here once.
Stay where you are.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
His ideas conflict with mine.
It was a stupid idea.
Sorry, something went wrong.
Are you busy?
He's a little taller than you are.
Tom has a white dog.
Stay where you are.
The soldiers returned to their lines.
We are the same age, but different heights.
I left my dictionary downstairs.
Health is better than wealth.
His sister can't talk to you today.
Were you listening to the radio yesterday?
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
We arrived first.
I didn't know you were awake.
We followed him single file till we reached the cabin.
Is there an elevator in this building?
Why are you speaking so loudly?
This patient is suffering from hypoxia.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
I'm trying to get my children back.
I will be sixteen next birthday.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
You speak a bit too fast for me. Could you speak a bit more slowly, please?
He went there instead of me.
I'm not an expert either.
I don't know whether I'll be able to attend tomorrow's meeting.
You're a very good football player.
I think we'd better wait a little longer.
Are you going to a movie?
I don't regret what happened last night.
I caused this.
Don't shoot.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.
I can show you a better time.
Are you courageous?
I'm just not very busy.
I can't remember very much.
That's not exactly what I meant.
Your pencils need sharpening.
They'll be rooting for you.
I am sure of his success.
Yesterday I bought a book.
I told Tom to take off his shoes.
I think that's up to you now.
Did you enjoy your winter holidays?
We find the defendant not guilty.
I'd like to go to Hawaii.
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn't have done that.
Please answer in French.
You think I'm scared, don't you?
Yours is over there.
Who does he look like?
What else did Tom say?
Ask me something easier.
Didn't it ever occur to them that they would be punished?
My uncle gave him a present.
Tom knew where he had put his keys.
My father is very nice.
I'm kidding.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
I'm never gonna let her live that down.
I don't care if you go or not.
Sometimes I wonder whether or not I made the right decision.
If he had received her advice, he would have succeeded.
The new president was a warm and friendly man.
Maybe it's not as hard as it looks.
He was burning up with fever.
I'd never do what Tom did.
The experience soured his outlook on life.
My mother disliked caterpillars, not to mention snakes.
Tom should be fired.
I realize that.
You don't have to answer.
What book did you buy?
I can help you.
Don't blame it on her.
We can't work without electricity.
I felt dumb.
English is a means of communication.
Is that a possibility?
He lives apart from his parents.
She asked me whether she could use the telephone.
Who is your favorite author?
She enjoyed conversing with him.
Everything went smoothly.
I'd better get to bed soon.
Step back.
I think we can help each other.
How many books do you have?
Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung.
You should prepare a room for the visitor.
Tom always asks for permission before he borrows my bicycle.
How's your morning been?
Tom dug a hole in the sand.
I finished reading the book last night.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
She is sharp.
Our guests are in a hurry.
Could you give me a ride?
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
I used to do that as a kid.
You're depressed, aren't you?
Who's your favorite writer?
I want you to be quiet.
Let me remind you of something.
No matter what you may say, I won't change my mind.
You don't have the nerve.
Are they worth it?
Does this make me look fat?
Everything is OK.
This app automatically signs you in when you open it.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
Do you think we should import rice from the U.S.?
Please shuffle the cards carefully.
What did I just tell you?
I just want to be prepared.
I'm happy enough.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I must help my mother.
I made you coffee.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I'll shut up now.
Do you know the man staring at you?
I recommend caution.
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
We're meant to be together.
I had to get out of there.
He expressed himself very well in English.
You should wear your hair down more often. It looks great that way.
My mother was usually very busy.
What good would come of it?
Where's your suitcase?
The missing cat has not been found yet.
I think this is yours.
I hope I don't lose.
That's nice to know.
I didn't take it seriously.
She called for help.
The boy is playing with his toy soldiers.
Tom isn't the type of person who learns from his mistakes.
Is this a date?
This watch cost me ten thousand yen.
Let me finish.
It will only take a minute.
I've already been shot twice.
How is everyone?
All of the town was destroyed by a fire.
I can't do that now.
This doesn't prove anything.
Don't let this chance slip by.
I'm retired.
Apes rank above dogs in intelligence.
Come here at once.
All of us, except him, went.
Don't forget the fact that smoking is bad for your health.
This is a happy occasion.
Your office is nicer than mine.
Let's look under the bed.
I hope we didn't wake you.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
I hate that color.
A man with a watch knows what time it is, a man with two watches is never sure.
Tom checked to make sure all the doors were locked before he went to sleep.
You should have helped him with his work.
I began living by myself.
I fed the dog.
I know how busy you've been.
I figured it out by myself.
How many times have I told you?
I respect you and your opinions.
Stop dating losers!
I wanted everything.
Figure it out yourself.
Can you forgive me?
What did you get hit with?
I hate weddings.
"May I park here?" "No, you can't."
I'm not who you think I am.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
I didn't spend anything.
I want to see for myself.
You must know Tom pretty well.
Look it up.
They left him for dead.
There is a river between Saitama and Chiba.
Take mine.
Are you motivated?
We missed our train.
We'll get started as soon as we can.
I think this belongs to you.
What we know of health we have learned from the study of disease.
I think we should be getting back.
After eating supper, I washed the dishes.
You aren't the easiest person to live with.
Thank you for closing the door.
She hasn't reimbursed me yet.
Come quickly. It's urgent.
Something you should know about me is that I'm very much a country boy at heart.
You don't have to answer.
You sure are pretty.
Tom scrubbed his feet.
City life has advantages and disadvantages.
The Titanic hit an iceberg.
She laughed so hard she cried.
I've been studying French for a long time, but I'm not yet fluent.
How long have you been dating?
Give me a coffee, please.
Do you have any money?
He has nothing to complain about.
I have a bus ticket.
She is curious to find who sent the flowers.
I don't think I can get you to understand how difficult that is.
The flights haven't left yet.
I don't know what to expect.
I am beginning to remember it.
Fear of failure prevents many people from reaching their full potential.
Don't come unless I tell you to.
I'm a biology student.
I made reservations.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
She took off her old shoes and put on the new ones.
I've been upset not having written you a reply.
She often calls him names.
My sister resembles my mother.
You're nothing but a coward.
I like big cities.
Today is Tom's birthday.
You weren't there, were you?
She married an American GI after the war.
I didn't catch your last name.
I don't mind if it's hot.
The heavy snowfall prevented our train from leaving on time.
Tom wasn't here today.
We should deal with this matter without delay.
I got upset.
No other student in the class is as brilliant as he is.
How's your sister today?
Do you know what that means?
It's a basic human right.
Thanks for photocopying it for me.
I just want to put it all behind us.
Every time I make a mistake, I learn something. The challenge is not to keep making the same mistakes over and over.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
The road curves gently toward the lake.
Why don't you help us?
I'm wearing sunglasses.
Of course, you're correct.
We could be happy here.
You don't get enough exercise.
Pneumonia causes difficulty in breathing.
We'll have loads of fun.
That's a hard one.
She speaks ten languages.
I will wait here until he comes back.
No one can go in there.
I'm saying no.
Where can I find toothpaste?
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
How many pencils do you have?
Maybe you did that wrong.
He will come if you call him.
Can I come some other time?
He turned the corner.
If two men always have the same opinion, one of them is unnecessary.
This just isn't like you.
Take care and have a nice day.
Tom is an intriguing guy.
The investigation concluded that the police officer had done nothing wrong.
You screwed up.
They were so happy together.
I like to sing songs.
I don't feel so well.
I don't like anything.
I don't feel sorry for you.
There are books here.
I really like puppies.
You've got a vivid imagination!
Tom never said that.
Are you ready for Christmas?
We're not all that stupid.
I knew something Tom didn't know.
He doesn't have his medication.
I'm lazy.
I haven't read today's newspaper yet.
You look smart.
You're not entirely wrong.
I thought I knew what to do.
We finally reached the top of the mountain.
We took action immediately so that things wouldn't get worse.
She spoke English to me just to show off.
Let's talk about this again tomorrow.
I sent it to you two days ago.
Tom needed your help.
I can't do this myself.
I don't particularly care.
You need to study more.
You are a doctor.
I'd like to have ketchup on the side.
The customer is not always right.
I'm really hungry. I haven't eaten all week.
Please give me that book.
I have a proposal.
That's what's driving me crazy.
You're always saying that.
Ask them.
Are there still enough chairs for everyone?
He is ashamed of his failure.
I only think of you.
He has a lot more money than I have.
I arrived too late and missed the train.
I didn't like this game until I started winning.
It's a matter of the utmost importance.
I refused to pay.
I don't really feel like reading.
Yesterday, he told me the truth.
All I want to do is finish what I started.
Tom poured some cereal into a bowl.
We were all disgusted.
I'm sorry things didn't work out.
What's the bottom line?
The tide is turning against Tom.
I want something sweet.
Dead men tell no tales.
I said he could go.
Get out of my house.
He never told anyone.
Strange to say, he didn't know the news.
The more stubborn you are, the more isolated you become.
He was born in Nagasaki.
What have you eaten today?
I want to find out who broke the window.
How do you stay up to date?
You're the teacher.
You're alone, aren't you?
Open your book to page ten.
She persuaded him to do it.
I've got things to do.
You've been selected.
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
I know I could've done that, but I didn't.
We could sing together.
Didn't you know that?
He set out for Tokyo this morning.
I want you to have a copy of this.
I can hear Tom.
You're in luck. The plane is on time.
That's not even funny.
I'll be free this evening.
I don't know that word.
No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked against us.
She is a singer.
I'm busy, so I can't go.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
You're aggressive.
I am going to sleep.
I can't accept your gift.
I want to quit.
Is there a bank near here?
He can't come with us.
I really need to talk with someone.
Be careful or you'll strip the gears.
There was no toilet paper.
The boy began to cry.
You're very generous.
Maybe that's a good idea.
Are you an only child?
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
They've just left.
I could be wrong, but I think Tom likes you.
May I have something hot to drink?
I want to do everything I'm expected to do.
When you're done with the book, put it back where you found it.
I'm from Kyoto.
Don't ever call me again.
Tom asked Mary to wake him up at six.
He cheated me.
How does he do this?
Love hurts.
Tom didn't actually do anything.
This offer is available for five days.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
Why is this light blinking?
Don't kill me.
At the moment, I have a pretty good job.
Be kind.
Take that box away!
She's a very nice girl.
How could you not tell me about this?
You're always complaining about something.
I know this.
It's very good.
I'm impatient.
Tom must be aware that Mary is John's girlfriend.
Tom didn't act quickly enough.
She was advised by him to work harder.
We opened this store in 2013.
I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
I feel like taking a day off tomorrow.
We're not used to it.
I can cook better than I can play tennis.
Absence of rain caused the plants to die.
Please shut the door behind you.
She called him every bad name she knew.
Tom didn't help me.
Isn't that just a prairie fire?
You are not Japanese.
I'm still a member.
I was a little afraid.
Sorry, I can't stay for long.
The wind calmed down.
My watch is accurate.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
Is that black bag yours?
His poems are difficult to understand.
He wants to squish the bug.
I think he's a man of ability.
I don't know what's happening.
I don't like the ocean.
I'm going to give Tom a bath.
I am ready to die.
I thought we had a good time.
She's too old for you.
I figured I might find you here.
Were there any problems?
I grow tomatoes.
Think carefully before answering.
Make sure to back up all your files.
I really want to see you.
Hey, wait up!
They renewed their vows on their 25th wedding anniversary.
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
He told me about it.
I was born the year the war ended.
He pointed to the tower over there.
Dr. Skeleton is known for his study on ghosts.
I know it's none of my business.
Tom knew Mary had kissed John.
I'll pick you up at your home.
You didn't work hard enough.
I have a friend living in London.
He opened the cages.
The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know.
You're the teacher.
We are responsible for your protection from now on.
I have no more than one thousand yen.
I'm glad you liked it.
Do you have an appointment with him?
The black telephone costs more than the white.
I don't really like you.
Suddenly, it became noisy.
Please refrain from smoking here.
It was effective.
They have a problem.
We're always hungry.
Don't give up.
Tom won't know.
What are you called?
If possible, I'd like to see him.
Don't ever lie to me again.
I wonder if I should talk to her about the problem.
Do I look pale to you?
The tide is coming in.
It's very interesting.
You must all leave.
Some animals can sense the coming of a storm.
He was a student at that time.
I'm glad someone told me.
I hope I can be of some help to you.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
You're no longer welcome in my house.
Will you have a cup of tea?
Please remain seated for a few minutes.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
Did you see Tom at school today?
I think you knew my father.
Get me something to eat.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
I feel fine now.
Her only hobby is collecting stamps.
We've met a few times before.
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
He was a Frenchman. I could tell by his accent.
Don't die.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Tom studies hard.
Our car broke down in the middle of the street.
The parcel weighs more than one pound.
Whose bicycle is this?
He had the last laugh.
Do you see a star?
It's a conspiracy.
I don't like him.
There is a cookie under the table.
He has a beautiful daughter.
I like your new hair color.
What he said is not true.
I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.
I've never seen Tom do what you say he always does.
You're grumpy.
I can't believe you chickened out.
You must think I'm a complete idiot.
May I use this telephone?
Why do you keep giving him money?
Everything is tough.
That's sweet of you.
Take a look at these.
Where do you want to go, sir?
You must be exhausted.
I'm very upset.
The students like it.
There used to be a prison here.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I'll show that to Tom.
I want ice cream.
I like this color.
What happened at that intersection?
I don't remember anything else right now.
Is anyone here?
That's not important now.
They are from the United States.
She had an early breakfast.
I'm sorry, we don't accept checks.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I'm ready for my next challenge.
I thought you'd want this one.
We all know what happened here.
You seem to have thought of something else.
You shouldn't talk about people behind their backs.
You're kind of cute.
He suddenly fell ill.
Everyone stayed calm.
They let me go.
I want my life back.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Keep searching.
I made fun of him.
Are you sure you aren't cold?
He's an oceanographer.
I get up at six every morning.
Those two are exactly alike.
I really appreciate your coming.
This isn't surprising at all.
There were no people in the village.
Don't feed the dog.
I'm all out of ideas.
It really was hard.
Tom slept on the train.
Tom took off his shirt.
There is a park in the middle of the city.
There's nothing more I can tell you.
What happened to my car?
I'm not a liar.
What grade did you get on the test?
I just want to help.
Exams are right after summer vacation.
Do you want me to call back?
I would like to see it.
To the best of my knowledge, the cathedral dates back to the Middle Ages.
He pays no attention to others' feelings.
You dropped something.
The doctor she visited is famous.
I would like to check yesterday's stock prices...
This cake is very delicious.
How nice!
He did well for a beginner.
Why aren't you coming with us?
Neither is true.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
With your approval, I would like to offer him the job.
I had no idea this bracelet was stolen.
Tom drinks milk every morning.
He picked up a butterfly between his thumb and forefinger.
He ran away when he saw the policeman.
Why did you listen to him?
Now let's celebrate.
I daydreamed all day.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
Tom broke the rules and was kicked off the team.
Tom can't do anything about it.
You're such a flirt.
Tom played his violin.
Enjoy your day.
You're fashionable.
A driver was sleeping in the car.
Dreams sometimes come true.
Have you ever shot anybody?
Don't light the candle.
You're driving me nuts.
We're enemies.
Keep your eyes closed.
Mary ironed her skirt.
Aren't you embarrassed?
That's the reason why I couldn't attend the meeting.
I'm afraid of heights.
You're elusive.
I don't remember actually deciding to do that.
He has no political ambition.
He is handsome and clever.
You didn't expect to find me here, did you?
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
He's able to speak Japanese.
You're afraid, aren't you?
I was lying on my back.
Could you tell me how to adjust the volume?
He begged for his life.
My career is on the line.
This photo was taken in Nara.
Will you come back tomorrow?
Brush your teeth after every meal.
I had no doubts.
I didn't mean to keep it secret.
Tom plays organ at our church.
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker.
She is often late for school on Mondays.
My daughter's driving me crazy.
Look at the sign just ahead of you.
Tom fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
I was very busy last week.
I was excited.
Still, the war was not over.
Everyone started talking at once.
The boy remained silent.
I'm from the West Coast.
Are you sure we're allowed to swim here?
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
Did I get it right?
I can easily give up chocolate to lose weight.
These books belong to me.
There's nothing new under the sun.
Why don't you mind your own business?
We had no trouble.
I'll never see you again.
I want you to remember this moment.
This book has a lot of pictures.
There's always a first time for everything.
He didn't get paid for it.
It's easy to lose your footing on loose gravel.
It's an incredible sight.
Could we have a table near the window?
When should I come again?
I said it was OK for him to go.
He doesn't want to live in the city.
Please look at me.
Children often ask me for money.
I want you to get started right away.
You're the greatest.
It's been seven years since we got married.
We don't want them to be uncomfortable.
Your sister is attractive.
Don't ask me to help you ever again.
Nobody knows how I feel.
You're annoying.
This is what you're supposed to do.
His sudden death was a tragedy.
When asked how to do it, he said he didn't know.
We had an unpleasant experience there.
Is anyone else going?
Are you bald?
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
Tom can't be older than me.
I didn't look at my feet.
I want to make friends with your sister.
She was lying face down on the bed.
I have fewer books than you.
Tell me why you want to go there.
I have never had more than $500 in my possession.
Everyone already knows anyway.
You scare me.
He rescued the child from the burning house.
He was unconscious for three days.
When did you become a teacher?
I have not seen him for a long time.
His wife is our Italian teacher.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I will probably get up early tomorrow.
I want to be invited.
He has coached us for half a year.
We're both right.
Corporal punishment is still allowed in many countries.
Tom was unreliable.
Before he died, he was almost blind.
Now, what was your name again?
Meet me there at midnight.
We have no school tomorrow.
Let me handle it.
You should stay away from Tom.
For now, I'd like to concentrate on this.
He has a Japanese car.
He became famous.
I'm leaving you tomorrow.
Have you heard the news yet?
What does this sentence mean?
Stay away from my daughter!
Tom is too irresponsible to have a pet.
Birds are flying in the air.
He kept me waiting for a long time.
Please be polite.
What's the matter? Just tell me.
The danger is minimal.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
He did his best.
I don't want to be rich.
Tom handed the map to Mary.
Take a little nap on the couch.
You're charming.
You should not despise a man just because he is poorly paid.
My friend helped me.
The stakes are high.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
He arrived earlier than usual.
Tom says he can wait a long time.
You should tell the truth.
They did the right thing.
Revolutions that don't succeed are soon forgotten.
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
His story must be true.
I translated everything Tom wrote into French.
I can't believe I cried.
I feel the same way as you do.
I can't believe everything that just happened.
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?
An electric guitar doesn't sound the same as an acoustic one.
I don't want meat.
No one welcomed the proposal.
Is anyone looking?
They want to become rich.
I'll be going.
He said he was tired, so he would go home early.
I met him several times.
Could you turn down the music, please?
The shower doesn't work.
He doesn't stand a chance.
Help me and I'll help you.
I'm sure you're going to like this.
I'm off to the gym.
Check these out.
He wore a pullover sweater to keep from getting cold.
Does Tom believe in God?
Why do you want to learn a foreign language?
The water came up to my knees.
You are not supposed to smoke here.
Something's on your mind, isn't it?
Her hair is turning gray.
This is a terrible thing.
Put me through to the boss, please.
I want to sort this out once and for all.
I felt happy.
I thought you'd never ask.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
He's ahead in the race.
Don't say anything unless it's important.
I tripped.
I don't care what's happened.
Who is currently the richest person in the world?
Is there anything to eat?
We hurried to the airport only to miss the plane.
Tom wants answers now.
Tom can't see anything without his glasses.
Do you think students are given enough time to eat lunch?
We can't attend.
I've never come across such a strange case.
I'll be with you in five minutes.
Do you want a car?
I don't like anything here.
Either you or I must go in his place.
It is just like her to think of others before thinking of herself.
You look great in these photos.
Once a bad habit is formed, it is hard to get rid of it.
I can't give you anything.
I really am glad you're here.
He is fond of swimming.
Tom is extremely narrow-minded.
Tom said he had a slight cold.
There is no film in this camera.
He paid no attention to my advice.
Did you make this?
I woke up at five this morning.
They kidnapped me, drugged me, and then brainwashed me.
We've spent too much money.
That is completely useless.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
How do you know so much about this?
You look happy today.
It's eight-thirty.
The doors wouldn't open, so I had to get in through the trunk.
Do you wash your hands before meals?
I was bored, so I wandered around town.
Could I use your pencil?
Would you like me to go there with you?
Tom still isn't taking us seriously.
I never oversleep.
I can't wait forever.
Do you want me to bring you something to eat?
Does that surprise you?
How much TV do you watch?
The station is a three-minute walk from here.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
That was totally my fault.
My family is very proud of me.
I'm assuming this is your father.
Everything's going to work out.
Don't look surprised.
You should have done so.
Help me print this.
I hope you don't do that.
This is the last train.
The baby screamed all night.
Don't change a thing.
Tom still despises me.
Make sure you don't let the dog outside.
I saw the movie on video.
Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried.
Were you at home all morning?
I'm not leaving the two of you alone.
You're always anticipating trouble.
Don't touch this with your dirty hands.
I have been reading this for a few hours.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Do you have a place to stay tonight?
That's amazing!
I am making too many mistakes.
Tom isn't afraid of anything.
He gave me what I needed.
Let me think for a while.
We're going to another party after this one.
I am sure that you will be satisfied.
He spoke highly of you.
He's still single.
Stop fooling around!
Does someone here speak Japanese?
Need anything else?
I can't take chances.
I'd like to go out with you.
He was outraged.
Tom took the hook out of the fish's mouth.
Your French is perfect.
I think you should take vitamins.
He had his head in the clouds in class.
You still have a chance.
Do you have an alibi?
Is the door open?
She ran very fast to catch up with the other members.
I wonder who.
Who will take care of the baby?
Leave her alone.
Tom is in the morgue.
He went skiing.
I won't stay here alone.
Look out the window.
I'm not ready to die.
I want people to know the truth.
Give it back to him.
You have many friends.
Do you know of an apartment I can rent that allows pets?
Tom doesn't want to work tomorrow.
I dream a lot.
My parents are asleep.
I had an asthma attack.
Tom had a good reason for being late.
I could not afford to buy a bicycle.
She brought me a cup of tea.
She wrote to him to tell him how wonderful he was.
Compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard.
He has nothing to do.
That's not exactly what I said.
From this point, we'll go on by car.
I have no beef with him.
Do you want any of this stuff?
These shoes are a little loose.
He has trouble remembering names.
Not every country belongs to the U.N.
She speaks English very fluently.
Were there any witnesses?
This is my final offer.
I'm studying in the library.
Father went to a lot of trouble to prepare dinner for our guests.
I thought your house was downtown.
Tom is in need of a vacation.
He was a real drunkard.
I love American movies.
I'm ordering you to leave immediately.
The children are safe.
You are curious, aren't you?
I don't want Tom to be unhappy.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Tom made a list of songs he doesn't like.
Turn down the music.
Here comes the waiter.
I think it's impossible for us to beat him.
She gave him a piece of paper.
My watch is more accurate than yours.
We cannot offer a further price reduction under the current circumstances.
We shouldn't have tried to help Tom.
Let's approach the problem from a different angle.
It is what everybody says.
We've made lots of changes.
You should not go alone.
This is a pen.
Would you mind speaking more slowly?
The kids jumped on the trampoline.
Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything.
This is a surprising discovery.
I know what to expect.
He can't even read, let alone write.
He had his hair cut.
What time does your plane depart?
I lost the door key, so I can't enter the house.
Now he has nothing to live for.
You're old.
He served his king faithfully.
You're disgusting.
I brought these flowers for you.
No one knows their name.
The urban-renewal project is now well under way.
I finally have enough money to buy the kind of car I've always wanted.
Just be glad you're OK.
They got a warm reception.
You have got to be kidding me.
Let me buy you a new one.
There is a place for everyone in the world.
What do you want to study?
A dictionary is an important aid in language learning.
Tom stopped it.
Perhaps Tom lied to us.
I forgot Tom's address.
Tomorrow is my first day of work.
How many of you live here?
Do you need our help?
You're all crazy.
She is almost as tall as you.
Stop putting off finding a job.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
I feel inclined to agree with her.
My cat is following me.
He hugged her.
Please call me as soon as possible when you arrive in London.
They swam.
These books are heavy.
That's just a personal opinion.
These aren't my keys.
Nobody had an answer.
Please push this button at once in case of emergency.
Do you have any beer?
She was disappointed with the result.
I have no objection.
That's all I want.
Where did the money really come from?
I said maybe.
You're opportunistic.
Grab the bottom.
Who did you think I was?
Will you ever tell me your age?
She got all the more angry because I kept silent.
No one was on board the ship.
I know Tom likes reggae.
You should tell him the truth.
Have you measured it?
You probably just want to be alone.
You tried to stop Tom from doing that, didn't you?
I own this place.
Which airport do I leave from?
He will not listen to me.
He's very upset by this.
How did you reply?
She liked it.
I can't get in touch with him yet.
It was a very difficult story to write.
It's been almost ten years, but you're as beautiful as ever.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
I have an ever growing list of to-do items.
No sooner had I gone out than it began to rain.
Tom read the story out loud.
You're very generous.
Tom noticed Mary's hands shaking.
She has a very strong personality.
How come you know so much?
I don't know if I have enough money.
I wish he were here now.
You can't keep this a secret.
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
I think we should call Tom.
We should be on our way.
Where would you like to sit?
We don't have this in Europe.
We're not proud of it.
People like you are never busy.
Do you find the work too hard?
I thought Tom was Canadian.
Do you know how to unlock this door?
What does this image make you think of?
I'll join you.
How do you go to school?
I have never seen anyone like you.
I hate my brother.
It's garbage.
Did I hurt you?
Mary and Alice wore matching outfits.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
Do you understand what's going on?
I'll follow you.
What's the fare to Liverpool?
That's exactly what I think.
How did you come by this painting?
Don't talk about yourself like that.
I feel there is just no way out.
I don't know why I bother with you.
For the time being, I intend to stay at a hotel.
He received me cordially.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
Hand over your weapons.
Those were the days.
We looked, but saw nothing.
Could you show me the way to the station?
Don't be so impatient.
They're stalling.
I'm very pleased with your work.
You can't blame me.
They abandoned the hill to enemy forces.
Where are your gloves?
He is present at the meeting.
Fill out this form.
I can't promise you anything.
Perhaps it will snow tomorrow.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't speak French.
He doesn't know how to play golf.
I think you might like it.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
I don't like your friends.
Tom loves Mary, but Mary loves John.
We used to live in Kobe.
Isn't that right?
We'll walk.
I think about you often.
They accepted each other.
You knew the answer all along.
Tom started a bonfire on the beach.
I think they're ready.
You need to be more careful.
Who will pay?
I asked him to drive me home.
I have some things to take care of.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
Criminals should go to jail.
The man blushed.
The plane took off at exactly ten o'clock.
I know every word on this page.
You're all alone.
We should ask Tom what he thinks we should do.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
He refused to pay.
This dress looks good on you.
Let's try something.
It goes without saying that honesty is the best policy.
Feel free to ask any questions.
Make sure you cut the board against the grain.
I never imagined he'd do that to me.
Do you need a ride home later?
He decided to submit his resignation.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
You'll soon be able to sing as well as Tom.
This sounds very interesting.
You must not give up.
We will have an English test this afternoon.
You were happy.
The wound left a scar on her arm.
I feel secure with him.
He was stoned.
I can't get the door to shut properly.
I hope that's good enough.
I can't be seen with you.
My wallet and passport are missing.
I wonder what she really means.
Are you up?
You said you were happy.
He has a few pens.
I'd like some sugar, please.
You don't have to apologize.
Maybe it's not that bad.
Tom doesn't know the difference between an adjective and an adverb.
She showed up at the party looking like a million dollars.
Not only did he teach school, but he wrote novels.
It looks like we're in for some nasty weather.
I excused myself for a minute.
He often laughs at his own jokes.
It's all settled.
He was the last to leave.
You'll get another chance.
I put my clothes in the dryer.
This is a good deal.
Soon, it won't be unheard of to live to 150.
Do you know that boy who's crying?
Tom walked in.
The boy made a paper plane.
I want for you and me to be happy.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
It was awfully funny.
The opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel.
He drove carelessly and had an accident.
Tom is a pharmacist.
I'm perfectly happy.
You tried.
I'll ask him.
Tom has a friend in Boston.
Tom is a great sportsman.
They live in that house among the trees.
I have done it before.
I caught him in the act.
She didn't say a word to me all night.
On the whole, my company is doing well now.
Tom bolted the door.
I don't know if we want to do that.
This is the third longest river in the world.
A moat surrounds the castle.
For some reason, people have been avoiding me like the plague ever since I got back from India.
Her slurred speech was an indication that she was drunk.
I won't bother you.
We'd like a double room with bath.
You might get something in the mail today.
Tell Tom what you mean.
That is how it happened.
Grandma is three and a half times your age.
I think I'd rather not know.
You're such an idiot!
I have some news for you.
Don't eat too much.
I don't drink before noon.
Get your coat.
What's your speciality?
We want to speak with Tom.
I'd like to file a complaint.
I only need one thing.
What's in there?
He had nothing to say, so he went away.
They died one after another.
Tom couldn't stop laughing.
Would you like more mashed potatoes?
Take care of it.
She pulled him out of the mud.
I studied hard when I was in school.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
You have to choose your own path.
She doesn't do anything else.
I asked my mother to wake me up at four.
Tell me how he got it.
Will you exchange this sweater for a larger one?
Who was that you were just talking to?
Money doesn't grow on trees.
We do this kind of thing all the time.
We're going to search the whole ship.
I just want to look at it, that's all.
We may not have time.
We should get along just fine.
I was talking to you.
You know everything.
The hostages will be released tomorrow.
Why don't you take a closer look?
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
How long have you been out of prison?
We shouldn't confuse solitude with isolation. They are two separate things.
I just didn't want to take any chances.
The fire was extinguished at once.
I got there ahead of time.
Tom isn't a bad boy.
They're good friends of ours.
He couldn't hold back his tears.
Everyone could easily see his disappointment.
I want to hold your hand.
How do I know this isn't another one of your tricks?
You're a traitor.
How much is there left?
He's always chasing girls.
I was just leaving home then.
Would you like to take part in the festival?
Tom will be back in a second.
We'll have to do this ourselves.
Her hair is long and beautiful.
Don't look at me.
She had twins.
Both of the windows were broken.
How long did you stay at the party?
They went to the beach.
If John phones me, please tell him I'll be back by seven o'clock.
Many young people in Japan eat bread for breakfast.
You've got to be bold!
I fell asleep listening to music.
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I never visit my sister.
She and her friends love music.
He often reads far into the night.
If you have something to say, say it now or pipe down.
I hope we can fix that.
How's work?
I don't need a boyfriend.
Tom will spend the rest of his life in prison.
We can't compromise on this.
It's really horrible.
I just got some good news.
You have too many irons in the fire.
When was the last time you hunted?
I must object.
Don't stick your hand out of the window.
I'm not done with you.
I don't see the relevance.
Take whichever of these you want.
I voted for Tom three years ago.
Was it all a dream?
We dissected a frog to examine its internal organs.
You came too late.
I like cities.
There's a spider in the shower.
At the end of a working day, everybody is in a hurry to get home.
I'm a patient.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
How long have you been learning French?
The street in front of my house is pretty narrow.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
Your efforts came to nothing.
She decided to marry him.
What happened at the beach?
Speak slowly and clearly.
I thought you were mad at me.
My grandmother is always complaining of the cold.
Our class has twenty-five boys and twenty girls.
I had an interesting day today.
I asked him not to bother me.
I think you're contradicting yourself.
Nobody threatened me.
Did you show it to your parents?
I'll take one.
No one believes him.
I'm already in a lot of trouble.
I can't even think about it.
I didn't see who was driving.
We're doing what we want to do.
I shouldn't have drunk so much beer last night.
They know things these people want to know.
She denied having met him even though we saw them talking to each other.
Let's treat everybody fairly.
Can you help me?
Tom said he would leave on Monday.
I'm going to start with this one.
You might not want to mention that.
What would your father think?
Money isn't everything.
When you get on the highway, shift into fifth gear.
How do you know which one is yours?
The wind is howling.
I want to learn Hebrew.
That's not very nice.
Why do you have your umbrella up? It's not raining.
I don't want you to be upset.
How much TV do you watch?
Take any train on track 5.
I need to have a word with you in my office.
I just want to take a quick look.
I'll talk to you later.
That's just not enough.
This young man knows little about his country.
Who's your favorite poet?
It's on its way.
You should know better than that.
He was too stunned to talk.
We tried to cheer him up.
What do you think I should write?
Nothing like that will happen again.
She advised him not to eat between meals.
What are you smiling at?
I am sorry to trouble you.
This is going to get messy.
I don't wear makeup at all.
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
I'm aware of the possibility.
I knew you'd know where to find Tom.
What a beautiful sunset.
I know you like chocolate.
Are you staying for dinner?
It's cold. Could you close the window?
I prefer to study in the afternoon.
I never thought Tom would do something like that.
Today is tomorrow's yesterday.
Do I look happy to you?
Tom can be relied on.
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
Please give my regards to your parents.
I'm glad I invited you.
He spoke about peace.
Today is the hottest day this year.
Frankly speaking, he is wrong.
A vigilante bypasses the law and takes matters into his own hands.
I need some sugar to make a cake.
I've tried to be your friend.
I thought it might be better to tell you now instead of later.
We are Australian.
She demanded to see the manager.
Tom helped us a lot.
They were having marriage problems.
He is afraid of dogs.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
He will also go.
Have you finished your homework?
It's our duty to help.
He told me that his father was a teacher.
I got very sleepy.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
They swam.
This plan is fool-proof.
Would you mind shutting the door?
I saw a cottage in the distance.
You're very understanding.
Look up the word in your dictionary.
I was not conscious of a man looking at me.
I think he's attracted to you.
Our teacher looks young for her age.
Are you responsible for this?
I do appreciate that.
You don't have to come.
Your secret will be safe with me.
Do you eat meat?
Tom wants to learn to sing in French.
I thought they were wrong.
Fill the bottle with water.
You sure are pretty.
Tom doesn't sing very well.
I wouldn't bet on it.
The same applies here.
He loves her.
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
I'll answer all your questions.
It was all gone.
You're very funny.
I think you're too picky.
We're quite alone.
The trouble is that I have no money with me.
I'm really looking forward to next March, when they roll out the new Play Station 2.
I've got a lot of good ideas.
I don't have any children yet.
I have only just begun.
Who's winning?
Would you like me to teach you how to play chess?
It seemed like you weren't interested.
Elephants are the largest land animals alive today.
Would you mind waiting a minute?
We came back to camp before dark.
It took me two hours to reach Yokohama.
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one away.
She called him every other day.
When did you start writing songs?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
Tom saw the newspaper on the floor and picked it up.
How could you not say something?
We'll pick Tom up on the way.
I really like seafood.
Tom doesn't know if Mary is dead or alive.
Tom is watering the flowers.
Where's the rest?
All the eggs went bad.
He has to speak English.
It's the best thing I ever did.
Hold fire.
I'm sure Tom intended to do that.
Take my advice!
Who am I talking with?
I don't like this anymore.
I'll take care of it right now.
Please do whatever you think is necessary.
You should have told me that before.
That movie was a real tearjerker.
Are you honest?
I won't come back again.
Tell me the truth.
The mouse was lured into the trap by a big piece of cheese.
Who's to say which is better?
An understanding of people is the greatest weapon you can possess.
You were both drunk.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
He sees everything in terms of money.
Do you guys smoke?
I relaxed.
He compared the copy with the original.
I want someone to talk to.
I relied on his kindness.
She attended the meeting.
The students must not enter the teachers' room this week.
I'm thinking of the plan.
Is that love?
I made Tom laugh.
We've been here before.
He came to my house.
I'm glad you're coming.
They know what's going on.
You might at least say "thank you."
Smoking is a disgusting habit.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
I was very busy last week.
I'm so confused.
There was not enough fuel.
Camping is impossible where there is no water.
I am from Brazil.
What happened to my car?
You're elusive.
Don't you want to go?
I'll keep it a secret. Don't worry.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
I felt left out.
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
I saw a light at the end of the tunnel.
I'll meet you outside.
Is he aware of the difficulty?
I know it's not impossible.
Nobody wants it.
I could barely contain my excitement.
I hate winter.
You won't have your way.
I thought about it a lot.
It's pitch black outside.
I've had a wonderful time here.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
It may well be that you're right.
How do you know all that?
He will be back shortly.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
Be careful about what you eat.
Lightning hit that tower.
You're unambitious.
I never wanted that.
Keep the door locked.
He blamed me for the accident.
Am I not right?
My parents caught me smoking.
The birds were flying in a group.
Drastic times call for drastic measures.
I didn't rescue anybody.
The red hat goes well with her dress.
What is today's date?
We'll cook.
I'd like to leave the city and rediscover nature.
You can park on either side of the street.
You're worried, aren't you?
I am leaving town for a few days.
Can you please look the other way?
What would you do, if you lost your job?
Tom laughed nervously.
I think something scared Tom.
He has a superiority complex.
He doesn't yet know the truth.
People shouldn't stare at foreigners.
This is mine.
You're awesome.
Would you like to take part in this risky experiment?
Thank you for your interest.
Please hand this in at the front desk.
How do you know where to go?
I really don't recommend that today.
She likes talking best of all.
No questions are off limits.
I can still hear you.
Tom often visits his aunt.
They know the truth.
We become forgetful as we grow older.
That's too much.
Don't come back until you've done what I've asked you to do.
You're lucky you didn't die.
You're such an idiot!
Tom backed out at the last moment.
He spoke for ten minutes without a pause.
It's broken.
You'd be the one to know.
What's this?
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
What do you want to do now?
I have things to attend to elsewhere.
I love weddings.
Did I hear you right?
Our school was founded in 1990.
The novel is worthy of praise.
It's booby-trapped.
What's happened here is a travesty.
I will go if you go.
I can carry that for you if you'd like me to.
You can't blame him for the accident.
I had the door repaired.
I don't like drinking.
I heard that a paralyzed man was eaten alive by maggots.
It's your book.
You can't believe everything you hear.
I was terrified.
I'm so glad I did this.
He told her that she was right.
She wore a red scarf around her neck.
Look at your map.
Do you want this done quickly or do you want this done right?
Pay attention to what Tom says.
Did you live here before?
She has totally changed her character.
Jeans are now in fashion among girls.
Please don't say anything embarrassing.
How's your wife, Tom?
An important quality of steel is its strength.
Don't breathe a word of what I've told you to anyone.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
Tom forgot to feed his dog.
That's not hard to do.
I'm lonely.
I beg you to help me.
A new building is being built in front of my house.
It is very cold here all the year round.
We are looking for a nice house to live in.
I accompanied her on a walk.
I'm really surprised Tom's not here.
The value of the dollar began to drop.
Do you think it'll be easy to find the kind of job you want?
He doesn't have a sister.
From space, the earth looks quite small.
He is able to swim like a fish.
I'm looking forward to that.
He can speak just a little English.
Don't you walk out on me.
It's dark in here. Do you have a flashlight?
Let me push the button.
Someone, please help me.
He goes there three times a week.
A piano is expensive.
I just need to be alone.
Try some of this.
I am a cat person.
Tom still hasn't answered my questions.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
Any child can answer that.
Why are you so interested in him?
Why do you always do that to me?
The bucket was full of water.
He fleeced three old ladies of their meager pensions.
Everybody in the building felt the earthquake.
She was fully clothed.
Give us a second.
After hearing the tragic news, he went outside to be alone.
Are you hurt?
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
Do you play any instruments?
I ate the salad.
This is a big help.
We can't live without oxygen.
I had fun.
When did you quit smoking?
Tom is eating.
I think Tom told you the truth.
He is roasting coffee beans.
She can speak French.
Do you have any ideas about it?
I think you are the one who broke it.
You're sad.
Please do not try this at home.
He will make a business trip to London next week.
Why in the world would I want to be a teacher?
They carried water in buckets.
Do you mean to go?
I want to live in either Boston or Chicago.
I do not feel like doing it.
She didn't know what to say to him.
She would not change her mind.
He's a tycoon.
Enjoy your meal.
Are you lost?
I felt like my life was over.
I have nothing to do with the crime.
Who was it that bought this skirt yesterday?
I like your cookies.
Isn't that where we first met?
Why pay when you can get it for free?
Tom is a bit older than Mary.
You're lucky that you have a job.
I'm careful not to spend too much.
Any chance of us getting approved?
I'm glad you met Tom.
How did you wind up doing this kind of work?
I just had a talk with your teacher.
Do you consider them dangerous?
It seems like an interesting job. What do you exactly do?
I loved it.
Don't forget to write to us.
Let me show you something really awesome.
It's all total nonsense.
I'm in trouble now.
Stop hitting your brother.
I don't understand Tom.
Tom is in excellent health.
Did you miss me?
Introduce me to your friend over there.
Why would you want me?
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
I wonder what to make for dinner.
She bought a new house the other day.
Her hobby was collecting old coins.
I might have done well on yesterday's test, but I do not know the results yet.
I can't see.
I thought you were against this proposal.
We must not give up.
He just texted me.
The garrison was forced to surrender.
There's no proof.
Tom doesn't want me around when Mary is here.
Please call me back in an hour.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
It's incredible.
Is anyone absent today?
The only thing that matters is that you weren't injured.
She left the old newspapers lying in a heap.
It keeps you on your toes.
She leaves for New York next Sunday.
Go a little faster, please.
What did they hit you with?
In the polls, both parties are on par.
The car bumped the tree.
I'm going back.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
That meat is chicken.
What happens next?
We played chess every morning.
Did you buy it on the black market?
He's always at home on Sundays.
Tom stopped me from leaving the classroom.
Tom certainly enjoys his wine.
I only found out a couple days ago.
You're spoiling the mood.
The boys have gone north.
We can be certain of that.
It was so dark that I couldn't see anything.
When will you ever learn?
Have I answered your question?
I'm the boss around here.
Let me know what you find out.
Tom doesn't seem much happier.
Will you give me something to drink?
You must get up a little earlier.
He does nothing but complain from morning till night.
She ordered the book from London.
We found all the boxes empty.
"Natto" smells awful, but tastes delicious.
I am looking for a book about medieval Spain.
Take this medicine after each meal.
He is not as well off as he used to be.
Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
He's a grouch.
What was the score at halftime?
He just texted me. I think he's drunk again.
Can we save the planet?
I thought you liked it here.
A man must work.
These oil fields have only begun to be tapped.
You can't give up now.
What happened to your guitar?
We expect rain today.
I'm really disappointed in you, Tom.
Are you seriously thinking about getting involved?
The bridge saved them a lot of time and trouble.
Go take a walk.
I know where she is.
Take off your clothes.
Your face is familiar to me.
I had my car stolen last night.
I want to know now.
What do I get in return?
Could you help me do this?
"Nice to meet you," said the businessman.
He doesn't seem to be aware of the problems.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?
Why are you talking to me?
Not feeling well, I stayed home all day.
You know we'd never hurt you.
This is something I don't understand.
When it rains, it pours.
I was very proud of that.
How do I do that?
Everybody sat down.
Did you like the meal?
Where are they swimming?
Who's the oldest person you know?
We're not arguing.
While you are asleep, the bodily functions slow down and body temperature falls.
The pain was more than he could stand.
I'm not very athletic.
He doesn't look happy to see me.
He had never seen such a bad boy.
I'm learning so much from you.
A wise man would not say such a thing.
That's the man whose wife died.
Learning a foreign language is fun.
They are not tired.
I'll look after your child while you are away.
Don't let it scare you.
I hear a lot of girls wear bikinis at that beach.
We've known each other since we were children.
How long will it take me to finish my homework?
I must continue.
We'd like a bottle of rosé.
I'm hiding.
Tom says he knows Mary won't eat raw carrots.
I should be there.
He appealed to us for help.
I suddenly feel very much alone.
Mom, could you read me a bedtime story?
Tom never really got over it.
Is Tom all right?
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
I am happy to have so many good friends.
Tom and Mary volunteered to clean up the park.
My mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
I thought you'd be grateful.
He kicked it.
His parents go to church every Sunday.
I didn't receive even one letter from her.
They've had enough.
Tom owns a small advertising company.
Something changed.
The horse is mine.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
That's very mature of you.
A motel is like a hotel only much smaller and is used mostly by people traveling by automobile.
I'm normal.
You don't have to get up early.
I need to talk with you.
I'll be brief.
May I be of assistance?
Some animals are afraid of fire.
This is Tom's room.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
You don't seem very concerned.
Our school library has many books.
I was paraphrasing.
The meeting finished at nine.
I won't miss Tom at all.
We don't have anything to eat.
Please make yourself at home.
I stayed in bed all day instead of going to work.
He retired at sixty.
This medication works instantly.
Come here, all of you.
We must go to bed early tonight.
It's obvious that he's not used to living on a tight budget.
You should get up early.
You shouldn't go to school.
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?
I will come by all means.
I don't know if I should tell you.
Turn off the light, please.
Main Street was blocked off all morning for the parade.
I hope everything will be fine in the end.
Are you fully recovered?
There is no air on the moon.
We want candy.
I don't hold grudges.
I was very, very lucky.
What do you want to do about it?
If you are a parent, don't allow yourself to set your heart on any particular line of work for your children.
You are too late.
I'm as shocked as you are.
They're really good at making clothes.
Don't let him approach.
Are they Canadian?
How do you say "hello" in French?
Do you often borrow Tom's car?
Why don't you sit down for a moment?
The heavy snow made them put off their departure.
A stranger came up and asked me the way to the hospital.
I really hope you're right.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
I have a cold.
The moon is out.
In case of an emergency, dial 110.
I don't even know your real name.
Tom is laughing.
She promised not to tell anyone.
Isn't one of you enough?
Did you try restarting the computer?
It could be better.
He went on singing.
He forgot to turn off the light.
What's it all mean?
I was in all day.
Here she comes.
You knew this would happen, didn't you?
They all died.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
The cherry blossoms are at their best in April.
It's possible that Tom lied to you.
Tom is violent and dangerous.
Life could be so easy.
Tom didn't mean to hurt you.
Why were you so slow?
I'll come with you.
Don't touch the glass.
I tanned myself on the beach.
We rent movies all the time.
Our eyes met.
I want you to take a look at this.
I am sorry to have troubled you.
Tom retired when he was 65.
Could you please give me some more examples of that?
Sooner or later, the hostages will be set free.
I need to warn my mom.
Tom is in a lot of trouble.
I have a friend whose father is a famous novelist.
What do you think I did?
Are we just friends?
How come you're not dead?
Does that mean you'll stay?
The world is changing more and more quickly.
I did it for you.
I had to walk home.
Give me some time to think.
I've eaten a great deal of food this week.
Tom started to take off his jacket.
Tom brought flowers.
This is all that's left.
We are not too young to tell what love is like.
I'm not used to being spoken to that way.
I pay most of my bills on the first of each month.
She made tea for me.
Tom underwent surgery.
See you all tomorrow.
My father is getting better and better.
He's lived here his entire life.
He talks too fast.
Tom didn't get paid for the work he did.
Japan is located in the Northern Hemisphere.
Hold on a minute.
Do you think the situation will improve?
They kept drinking.
You're greedy.
Are you going to go with me or not?
I have six mouths to feed.
The government must make fundamental changes.
You're really awesome.
All you have to do is to wait.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
He ran away at the sight of a policeman.
Whose room is this?
This probably means war.
Don't get so carried away.
Do you like summer?
That's the way.
I hope that you are good.
I finished work at six.
Tom spoke to the doctors in French.
That's a generous offer.
Tom changed his diet.
I'm glad you appreciated that.
He is studying at his desk.
How many plums are there?
I don't know exactly how to do this.
We can't let them do that.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Why don't you do that by yourself?
I will speak to him alone.
Should we have some lunch?
I have some errands to run.
I'm not going, and that's that.
How long were you at the party?
I would have written a longer letter if I'd had more time.
I want you to be prepared.
I made a couple calls.
Welcome to Japan.
Will you go, too?
I kid you not.
I can't eat fruit in the morning.
If you do this, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
It makes a big difference to me.
The mother is looking for a babysitter.
Wouldn't you like to drink some tea?
Tom is in intensive care.
What a hassle!
We're looking for some computer-savvy people to work for us.
If you really cared about your girlfriend, you would respect her feelings.
I'll act as a guide for you.
You were beginning to worry me.
She sat next to him wishing she were somewhere else.
I can't afford to buy a new car.
I get nauseous whenever I fly.
I owe you a lot.
I couldn't find it.
We improved the quality.
You're free to leave now.
Of course!
I was happy then.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
I slept only three hours.
I'd like to live in Australia.
Are you going to take part in the contest?
I have been a teacher for 15 years.
You may take this book as long as you keep it clean.
Somebody tipped off the gang members to the police surveillance.
I have read the book before.
Is eating healthy more costly?
Look after Tom.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
You have restored my faith in humanity.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
If he'd been there, he'd have told you to mind your manners.
Please let us know.
It was raining so hard that we had to put off our departure.
I'm really concerned about your future.
They laugh at him behind his back.
What do you have to do?
Do you have health insurance?
My homework took longer than I expected.
I followed all the rules.
Be nice to her.
In the end, we ended up eating at that shabby restaurant.
Take your elbows off the table.
I want to get married, just not to you.
We could all see it coming, couldn't we?
My birthday is coming soon.
Did you enjoy the tour?
My stomach's full.
Is it nearby?
I often told you to do your duty, but you would not listen to me.
He fell in love with her at first sight.
He is precisely the one you are looking for.
I've had enough of your excuses.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
Are you pointing at me?
I think it's time for me to organize a party.
He finally bent to my wishes.
Why am I so tired?
Do you still have feelings for her?
She advised him to talk about his life in America.
Who is the man playing the violin?
Water, please.
Visit us tomorrow.
He's not a team player.
I can't stop procrastinating.
Even though he was sick, he went to school.
Some flowers bloom in spring and others in autumn.
Tom was Mary's late husband's best friend.
He has a cat and two dogs.
He has a grip of steel.
Tom accidentally shot himself in the foot.
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
Nobody was able to suggest a solution.
I have a sharp pain in my chest.
You need to wash your hands.
Do you want to leave it like that?
I would like to visit you.
If you get your right ear pierced, that means you're gay.
I don't like the way he looks at you.
Where did you hide it?
I think it'd be better if you didn't do that.
I think his name is Tom.
What's the solution?
Stop showing off!
I rang the bell.
He had a copy made of this key.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to spend her summer vacation.
You'll get plenty of chances to meet girls when you go to college.
Follow your desire.
Don't take it personally.
Keep your head low.
Am I going too fast?
Can I call you back?
How many did you want?
You have a lovely daughter.
No one wants to admit it.
There isn't much butter left in the refrigerator.
I glanced through the brochure.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
Step away from the car and put your hands on your head.
Tom is John's older brother.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
He is bankrupt.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
You're not leaving until I say it's OK.
He served in the House for twelve years.
Which party do you belong to?
The more I get, the more I want.
My neighbor is nice.
We're going to miss doing this.
She teased him.
Why didn't the police notify us?
Tom got another letter from Mary today.
You have a lot of books.
Do you know where he lives?
Be careful about what you eat.
That's the tough part.
I think it's time for me to leave now.
I don't have a sword.
I like your scarf.
I know I have a lot to learn.
There's a bit of a wind today.
Sometimes when it's very cold, I can't get my car to start.
How long do you plan to stay in this country?
The red lines on the map represent railway lines.
I am glad to help you.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
Don't go in that building.
If you have any difficulty, ask me for help.
That restaurant serves excellent food.
She went with him to the zoo.
Wait, why am I telling you this?
I hope you will be completely cured.
Are you all alone?
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve.
I should've known better.
I'm ticklish.
I haven't had much sleep.
I met the prince himself.
Where's the checkout counter?
His comments about the book were favorable.
He made an effort to get to the station early.
My father bought me a bicycle.
Tom eats a lot of Chinese food.
I think you need a vacation.
He's mumbling something.
He invited me to the party.
He was in the army for thirty years.
I didn't mean to surprise you.
It was fair.
What are you watching?
Shut the door tight.
It is imperative for you to act at once.
All we need is a little patience.
I don't like to take on such heavy responsibilities.
That is a leather belt.
I've studied French, remember?
How tall you are!
How old is that dog?
He is subject to fits of anger.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
His son is a genius.
Do you want me to be happy?
Are you afraid of getting hurt?
What are your conditions?
He came close to losing an eye.
I have read sixty pages, while he has read only ten.
He was absent because of illness.
Do you mind if I park here?
The guy who hit you is at the front door.
This is so disappointing.
His son became a famous pianist.
Put it there, not here.
I don't know why I'm in a bad mood this morning.
I was really young when I met you.
I appreciate the effort.
What a beautiful woman she is!
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
Was that really worth it?
Fill the bucket with water.
He has a Toyota.
Why is my sister so mean to me?
I am worried about my mother's health.
They always go skiing in the winter.
We were not prepared for the assault.
I'm working too much.
This truck is in need of repair.
He failed to become a cabinet member at that time.
There was no response.
Sorry, but I have to hurry. I have no time to explain this in detail.
Have you eaten yet?
Was anyone in the room?
Tom must be tired.
You don't have to worry.
Are you saying you don't want to be a teacher anymore?
I'm methodical.
You know how it is.
Don't start doing that.
It's all over.
I did what was necessary.
I want you to return to your seat.
He is angry with you.
Is it hazardous?
I'd rather walk than wait for a bus.
We haven't lost much.
Give her this letter when she comes.
Your watch is on the desk.
No one saw anything.
Many people use ATMs to withdraw money.
Have you asked the others?
I'm resilient.
This dog bites.
It was a divine intervention.
This is the fastest car in our showroom.
I'm inviting you.
Tom is a good cook.
She has a thing for older men.
I am very tall.
Your father got a promotion.
The government was obliged to make changes in its foreign policy.
She advised him not to go.
Your shirt is inside out.
Think globally, act locally.
He retired at the age of 65.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
He went to see her the other day.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
We all live within a five minutes' walk from each other.
I don't want to take care of a dog.
Who would like to go first?
He is a gentleman.
I will teach you to program, but not today.
I don't know either of the two sisters.
It's cold.
The girl went into the forest to look for mushrooms.
Isn't that what you said?
An old proverb says that time is money.
To tell the truth, I do not like him.
What were you thinking?
He lives within his means.
It could just be your imagination.
Every word in this dictionary is important.
I have no idea what'll happen.
I thought you'd got lost.
Why did you come here?
I'll meet you outside.
Go to the store.
Weigh your words well.
He tried to put the fragments of a broken vase together.
The cop went through his pockets, but found nothing.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
He gave me an example.
He's a rather rare individual.
Tom says he regrets doing that.
The older we grow, the less we dream.
Don't spoil your appetite.
I don't even like you.
We're all to blame for that.
You should have been more careful.
Tom's alive.
It's not subjective.
The cat crept toward the bird.
The medicine didn't do me any good.
You're in grave danger.
Ah! That clears up everything.
I need to charge my cell phone.
A man is more or less what he looks like.
The boy came running into the room.
I didn't know you were awake.
I have bruises all over my body.
I rechecked the data.
You were hurt, weren't you?
How long have you been in Australia?
We ought to be ready for whatever comes.
Will you join us?
I am very hungry.
I had better ask her.
I want my children to have the best of everything.
He was killed in the war.
We didn't think of that.
I still have mine.
He wants to work in a hospital.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
What kind of music do you like?
I know an American girl who speaks Japanese very well.
I was disappointed in her.
It is raining all the time.
They finished their meal.
He does not get up early.
I was just joking.
You need to hurry.
Is your father a teacher?
They despise you.
Are we lost?
I just don't want to fight with you.
I'll give you back the money tomorrow.
I don't like being surprised.
I want to show you what Tom gave me.
I thought you had all the answers.
He speaks French.
Make it quick.
Will it be fine tomorrow?
They worked each day from the time the sun rose until it set.
I work during the night.
I knew that already.
There are more cars on the road in the summer than in the winter.
Don't enter the room until I say "All right."
Do you really want to win?
What's all that about?
I know you're richer than me.
Take a chance.
I tried to protect you.
The poor old man became so thin that now he's just skin and bones.
Both of them started laughing.
Did somebody call the police?
Do you feel like having a drink?
Your sweater is on backwards.
Beautiful woman, isn't she?
No one can predict where lightning will strike.
Do you still have feelings for him?
He wants to sell his old car to a man in Kobe.
You make it sound very simple.
The product is guaranteed to be free from defects.
I'm alive.
I will go if you go.
It's your only shot.
Do you understand how serious this is?
We feed our dog three times a day.
Dust off the shelf.
I didn't know where else to go.
Could you knock a little off the price?
Yesterday it rained the entire afternoon.
Tom didn't get very far.
You must be less impatient.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
I don't want to participate in the ceremony.
That's not acceptable.
I've been looking all over for you.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
This plant is good to eat.
He made for the door.
Thank you all so much.
Disconnect the plug.
You should not go alone.
I'm a little thirsty.
I can swim as well as you.
Do you shower every day?
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday.
I was dancing.
He began to play an old song.
Drugs can ruin your life.
I need a little help here.
When am I supposed to do that?
Come off it!
Make it smaller.
What's all this noise?
Tom, it's not your fault.
We're quite alone.
I can prove it to you.
I make you nervous, don't I?
I was naive.
The meat's not ready yet.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
We can do so much more.
Do you think it's a good idea to feed your dog table scraps?
Be creative.
He doesn't eat raw fish.
I hadn't planned to tell you anything about this.
Can we go?
The place is surrounded by cops.
You're selfish.
I rescheduled.
The author is Brazilian.
I recommended Tom for the job.
We're contented.
We have come a long way.
That probably is true.
I came here to tell you what I found out.
You have a lot of books.
I want a chair.
I guess I've gotten lazy.
I'll never forgive you as long as I live.
She made him a simple dinner.
He nodded to me as he passed.
That's what I'm saying.
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you.
You have my attention already.
Do you want a little cake?
Tom remembered that Mary and John had tried to kill him.
I talk to myself.
I'll help.
He retired to his own room after supper.
I'd be careful with that if I were you.
You can't buy it anywhere but there.
Fresh food is wonderful.
I need some paper.
I thought I had until 2:30.
It's your bedtime.
I shouldn't have walked home late at night by myself.
I'll never forget visiting Paris last summer.
I can't eat any more.
Paper napkins are sold in packs of ten.
You're too polite.
He is the happiest man on earth.
Save it on the external hard drive.
I am very hungry.
Tom told Mary to shut up.
Mary isn't as pretty as her sister.
You can't leave me hanging.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
I'm truly sorry.
Where did you see the boy?
Tom doesn't know that he's adopted.
I broke his heart.
No one knows what happened.
She stood transfixed as if she had seen a ghost.
I had hoped we might become friends.
I want you to know that.
I need a good pair of sunglasses.
I'm not afraid at all.
I fell into the water.
Nobody knows the truth.
What is it you really want to tell me?
Preserves must be stored in a jar with an airtight seal.
They stopped talking.
This is not very stylish.
I want this fixed as soon as possible.
I remember playing the original Pac-Man game when I was a kid.
Did you sew this by hand?
There's no way I'm going to do that.
What does he say in his letter?
Could you go to the store and grab some eggs?
I'm involved.
It's really big.
Not everyone agrees with you.
It was dark under the bridge.
Give it to me straight.
I'll babysit your kids for you.
I didn't think this was your seat.
How good are you?
You're amusing.
It's about time you went to school.
The sky is clear and full of stars.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
You seem a little desperate.
How many instruments do you know how to play?
I hope you're not going to disappoint me.
What did I do wrong?
Come with me to the station.
Do you all feel that way?
Thanks for the advice, Tom.
I never imagined I'd feel this way about you.
Would you like to switch seats?
I saw you there.
Tell me what really happened.
I'd like you to cut my hair.
Tom thinks this price is reasonable.
It's fun to learn slang words in foreign languages.
I hope you'll soon get well.
Families began to have fewer and fewer children.
I just want to be perfect.
Read what's on the label.
Be creative.
The radio is too loud. Can't you turn it down a little?
I didn't want to involve you.
Are you really going to let Tom do that?
It is very hard to live up to your reputation.
Tom looks great.
I can't hear what they're saying.
They talked about culture.
I'd like to give it to Tom.
We can't tell anybody.
Are you ready for the next problem?
You're replaceable.
He earned as much money as possible.
She was injured in a fall.
I fell asleep.
That's an interesting choice.
Are you losing weight?
I want to know why Tom couldn't come.
You can trust him. He'll never betray you.
If anyone were to talk to me like that, I would call a police.
That's only a temporary solution.
You don't have a temperature.
Don't make me lose my patience.
I appreciate anything you can do.
Why are you so insecure?
That's the way I like it.
Where were they going?
Thank you for your recommendation.
There's a rumor in the air that the firm is going into bankruptcy.
Don't talk to the driver.
I plan on winning.
I don't know which to choose.
Mary is going to have a baby in October.
He wants you to come home.
It's more complicated than I originally thought.
He often drives his father's car.
He brought me back in his car.
I don't know how many minutes we've got.
If you mix blue and red, you'll get purple.
I've lost my umbrella. I must buy a new one.
Tom persuaded Mary to do it.
Tom started shaking.
We take good care of them.
Wait right here.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
She bought chicken.
He dumped me.
Shouldn't you take a break?
I will do anything that you ask.
I got you confused with your oldest brother.
All of a sudden, the clerk lost his temper.
My feet are always cold.
Are you happy here?
Without you, I would've died.
This is how I did it.
I can be there in an hour.
What time did you close the store last night?
You can't keep something that big a secret.
Do you have a blog?
You took advantage of me.
That was the idea, wasn't it?
I won't tolerate it anymore.
Someone told me that Albert Einstein said, "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen."
During droughts, farmers are barely able to eke out a living.
Don't be so impatient.
Walk slowly.
Tom looks a little uncomfortable.
The night was cool.
I saw him.
Would you like a glass of water?
Are you hiding something?
I can't wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this.
Two heads are better than one.
I thought you and Tom were going to go to Boston.
Don't delete this file.
It's open to interpretation.
I lost my flashlight.
How did we get into this situation?
If I were in good health, I could pursue my studies.
Thanks for your comments.
I came with my friends.
Can you help me on this one?
How much is the entrance fee?
They found us.
I don't feel like celebrating.
It'll be a difficult decision.
A trip to the Riviera should do you good.
From the hill, we could see all the buildings in the city.
He has adapted extremely well.
I admire your determination.
I began to speak.
Hold on a minute.
Don't think about that anymore.
Ain't that cute?
Mother Teresa was given the Nobel prize.
Read as many books as possible.
Tom, I'm happy for you.
Would you please stop talking?
Step forward.
He was opposed to monopolies.
Have you seen my coat?
The comic scenes in the play were overdone.
Please explain the rule to me.
He's in hot water.
I'll destroy it.
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
I'm glad I got to see you again.
Tom didn't understand Mary's joke.
I am human.
You'd better not go.
I'm not sure I believe you.
The Nozomi is the fastest of all the trains in Japan.
How long did they live in England?
He is very careful.
Will you please wait on me, miss?
On your mark, get set, go!
I always walk.
She does look tired.
You can't hold me responsible.
Wires transmit electricity.
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't like snow.
Five years have passed since they came to Japan.
I can live with that.
We're not turning back.
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
Tell me I'm not dreaming.
I have only just begun.
What happened in here?
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
My brother is stronger than me.
Our plane took off exactly at 6 p.m.
We're just lucky.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I want to sleep for a while.
Did you call anyone else?
I figured you might change your mind.
I miss you badly.
There are only five minutes left till the train leaves and she hasn't appeared.
Promise me you'll be careful.
You may not remember me, but I remember you.
They all can drive.
They forced me to take the medicine.
He is proud of having won the prize.
What have we done to be punished like this?
It's very easy to use.
Give me your phone number.
She cried as she read the letter.
She lived with him all her life.
He is already here.
Who will you be coming with?
Will you drive me home?
I miss her a lot.
I have no idea what you mean.
Stop it. You're making me blush.
It's quite safe.
I just don't have what it takes.
You've got another four day's journey before you reach Moscow.
If you keep trying, you will make progress.
According to the weather forecast, the typhoon is likely to approach the coast.
Lock your door.
He explained to me that he had no money.
I can't describe how I felt.
He's always on time for his appointments.
Have a good time.
You're no singer.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
She practiced typing every day.
Tom has no prior criminal record.
I thought we had more time.
He glanced at his watch.
I dream about you every night.
This stuff is amazing.
Tom says he has no trouble falling asleep.
Why is your French pronunciation so good?
Tom began to search the house.
I only read the first three chapters.
Are you busy now?
We're all retired.
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
This is boring.
You owe Tom an apology.
I enjoyed your company.
Where are you going this afternoon?
I didn't cry.
I'm an engineer.
I like it when you do that.
You'll have a hard time.
I'm no friend of yours.
I thought I'd surprise you.
My car is now being repaired.
The meeting is held twice a month.
What has brought you here so early?
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't leave the house last Saturday.
They're gone.
Would you like to come to my party?
I saw you with Tom.
Let's talk about what you did in Boston.
I ate a salad for lunch.
His father had died of cancer 10 years ago.
You can't hypnotize me.
Am I under investigation now?
Don't look so sad.
He keeps a diary in English.
That's very disappointing.
There's a body in the trunk of the car.
I'm helping people to buy things online.
We want you to take it.
He can come.
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
You should apologize to her for being rude.
I left you a message.
Shake my hand.
I never could hide anything from you.
I'm a tourist.
The word is on the tip of my tongue.
I spoke with the minister myself.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
It was an awful week.
I wish you hadn't found me.
This is between you and me.
I wish I could stay longer.
Why do you always seem to want to argue?
I will follow you wherever you go.
Tom has already gone to school.
She acknowledged having made a mistake.
It doesn't surprise me that you know.
You're not dead.
What would you like to do tomorrow?
I'll be back at six.
Can you afford it?
I'm loaded.
He can't tell right from wrong.
I'd like to go out with you.
She is devoted to her children.
I can't believe you actually said that.
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
Bread is made from wheat.
I would like to improve my English pronunciation.
He kept the window closed.
Are ghosts real?
Do you have any idea where Tom might have put his camera?
She advised him to go there alone.
I never touched Tom.
I can't go out.
Nothing's working.
The royal jewels are kept under lock and key.
There's so much I want to show you.
I completely forgot.
She knit him a sweater.
It's not fair to you.
Patting me on the shoulder, he thanked me for helping him.
Congratulations!
Let me die.
All of us stared at her.
Who said I had a gun?
How did you get interested in art?
Your sister cannot swim well, can she?
I don't need them anymore.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
None of us are against his idea.
Be more precise.
You must get off at the next station.
I cannot afford a camera above 300 dollars.
I went to Nagasaki.
We can't see anything.
My mother is preparing breakfast.
What's in all these boxes?
Are you still sleepy?
He hung up.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
How do I get reimbursed?
I don't plan on telling you anything.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
Tom lost the race.
The rain shows no sign of stopping.
Everyone knows the law.
He's enjoying himself.
Where are you bound?
I got a flat tire.
They work at night.
Stay away from my daughter!
I think the time is right to introduce this product.
I can't afford a camera as good as yours.
I want to see your mother.
I've never felt better in my life.
They will be very glad.
They never did what they said they would do.
How may I help you?
We heard the sound of gunshots.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
Avoid crossing this street when it is raining.
Did you plant pumpkins this year?
Please come this way.
She got into hot water when her boyfriend called her at work.
Is there a problem?
My sister usually walks to school.
I think Tom may be sick.
I just want to make sure it's not poison.
I like their house.
I speak from experience.
I thought it would be fun.
Tom told me he's getting married.
I thought you were at work.
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
Please send me a picture of yourself.
We're less than halfway to the top of the mountain. Are you already tired?
What is the main industry in this town?
Our task has been easy so far, but it will be difficult from now on.
Do you know about that?
In case of emergency, call the police.
That's not funny.
You've run out of things to drink.
What he said made us angry.
She knit him a sweater.
Tom saw Mary.
Where's your boyfriend?
Tom got home later than usual today.
I gave her my word I would be back home by nine.
I like being single.
I didn't kill Tom.
You can smell the ocean from here.
Tom died in prison ten years ago.
No one knew who did it.
She gave me an album as a birthday present.
How much longer will I have to stay in the hospital?
I don't know what the big deal is.
This is sickening.
Tom noticed several differences.
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
Unexpected stuff happens all the time.
Are you afraid of the dark?
You don't have the guts.
Let me explain the rules.
I amused myself.
If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life.
I'd like to see your sister.
Are all the passengers aboard?
I never drink at home.
I hate it when there are a lot of people.
Tom heard a loud noise.
Just keep moving.
Are you coming with us?
I dislike eggs.
School violence is a big problem.
How did you know that man was a cop?
I've never read a novel in French.
He accomplishes whatever he sets out to do.
A lot of trees were cut down.
Everybody needs a hobby.
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
I want to hear more about this.
Draw a line from A to B.
You pay for the convenience of living near a station.
Choose any one from among these.
I had stuff to do.
Where would you like to go next?
One of them is a spy.
It was a case of mistaken identity.
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?
I can't believe what an idiot I've been.
They want a few more hours to finish the report.
I'm not available right now.
I want each of you to take out a piece of paper and write down what happened.
I refuse to listen to your excuses.
Three more passengers got on the bus.
It rained heavily.
I am interested in Japanese history.
Sometimes we lie to keep from hurting someone else's feelings.
You should put on some clothes.
Maybe he likes you, too.
I was planning on going to the beach today, but then it started to rain.
Can you clean your bedroom?
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
Do you think you and I are compatible?
I met your father yesterday.
This can't wait until tomorrow.
Tom walks faster than Mary.
I'll have to work hard.
Tom is probably with Mary.
We can't tell anybody.
The doctor started to examine her.
Please be careful.
Are they taking care of you?
I can't believe you lied to me.
I wonder how that works.
I just want to be near you.
Leave us alone.
He's got an uncle who works in a bank.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Start running.
The same holds true for Germany.
The dog kept me from approaching his house.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
Tom got very mad.
No one will miss me.
Tom is driving.
It's very kind of you.
Be friendly.
I'm going to college.
Are you here to arrest me?
You may use my typewriter.
My grades have improved significantly.
I'm going to change all that.
You gotta get more organized.
Look back!
Maybe that's a good idea.
My mother cut the cake.
I work in a pharmacy.
That's all they had.
I told Tom that what he was doing was illegal.
Tom is an intern.
Children are prohibited from smoking.
Open the windows.
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.
You're too polite.
I want to help you, Tom.
I can't do two things at once.
He got his doctorate.
Put down your pencil.
He is very clever for a boy of ten.
He is always dwelling on the pleasures of the past.
Forget I said anything.
I didn't buy them.
You're no different.
Follow my advice.
I really appreciate your coming.
The truth is that we can't live without air.
What do tigers eat?
I don't understand this word.
It is still unclear what caused the accident.
We need an answer.
Put down your weapons!
He sat there smoking a pipe.
She woke him up.
It's cloudy today.
I don't like it, either.
We don't even know what we're fighting for.
I can't hide out forever.
Have you ever been arrested?
You think I don't know what's going on?
So, do you really want to do this?
Ask at the police station over there.
We're halfway there.
You can run, but you can't hide.
Even if it should rain, I will start tomorrow.
Tom has done it enough times.
I'm feeling fine now.
The answer is still no.
We're all here.
"I'm not accustomed to working day and night." "You'll soon get used to it."
Put the coat on the hanger.
How many of us were there?
Pull over here.
Just let me handle this.
I want to talk to you about this report.
I just want to get my work done.
Please don't make me eat that.
This pond has a lot of carp.

The moral of the story is that you can't trust the system.

The queen visited the museum.
Did you ever talk to him?
It isn't important.
Lighten up.
Not all birds can fly.
You should have come earlier.
I'd like you to look after my dog.
I don't know what I'm doing yet.
You stay there.

What do you advise me to do?
No matter what you say, the answer is "no."
I was pleased.

I regret what I said.
I keep a rabbit as a pet.
I gained back the weight I'd lost over the summer.
That proposal may be a way to kill two birds with one stone, but we also have to be careful not to get greedy and spoil everything.
We know you're interested.
I like loud music.
You're not thinking clearly.
We'll never get through it.
Did you think about our offer?
Are you trying to kill me?
Don't worry. You'll make it.
Guess who's coming for dinner.
Five tremors in excess of magnitude 5.0 on the Richter scale have shaken Japan just this week, but scientists are warning that the largest expected aftershock has yet to hit.
You're not alone anymore.
Do you want me to be happy?
My father is not as old as he looks.
Many people in these parts have fallen on hard times.
Are you ready to begin?
Tom was dressed in black.
I want to be treated with respect.
Tom is leaving.

Hollywood marriages rarely last.
Tom is sincere, isn't he?
One of the guards is dead.
He prided himself on his punctuality.
I think you'd better go.
Give me two minutes.
I haven't told anybody else.
We carried out that plan.
We received an immediate answer to our letter.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
I appreciate that.
We can't be sure.
Give me a call tomorrow.
I owe him some money.
Do you sometimes give your sister money?
What are you reading?
He acted the part of King Lear.
They all did it.
Show him how to do this.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
It's too far away.
Is that right?
The rich are not always happy.
Do you know where the others are?
Are all of them your friends?
Where are you living now?
Why exactly did you do that?
There's something happening here that I don't quite understand.
Don't make a sound.
He works for a bank.
He presented an argument for the war.
He came out on top.
Some kids are playing in the park.

Why should I go to school?
You should be out of here by tomorrow.

He said that his father was ill, but it was a lie.
She is apparently an honest woman.
Tom has a dog.
I don't like dogs.
It was impossible for the boy to swim across that river.
From a distance, that stone looks like a person's face.
I need you to go home.
He's different from before.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
You should not go alone.
Tom's gun is missing.
Take care of yourself.
It's not gonna bite you.

An old man broke into our conversation.
The dog was out of breath.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
It took exactly an hour.
I'm using that cup.

Could I work part-time?
It is a six hours' drive from Sofia to Varna.
Are you afraid of it?

You must take advantage of the opportunity.
He lives somewhere about here.
No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember that song's title.
Don't try to blame this all on me.
The restaurant is on the ground floor.
He felt perfectly content.

You're done working, aren't you?
Tom helped us all.
Everything's taken care of.
I went into details.
I do not read books.
I don't know about you, but I'm starved.
Tom shot Mary.
He zipped his bag shut.
I want to join your team.
Give me one good reason.
Tom checked Mary's pulse to see if she was still alive.
The train came to a smooth stop.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
I woke up.
This is true of adults as well as of children.
Does Tom really deserve to be punished?
What else can you do?
I know you're not lying.
He was ready to face his fate.
I'm tired of listening to your bragging.
Stay out of it.
We began on a new project.
Maybe we really are alone.
I can't start up my computer. What am I supposed to do?
Treat her well.
I'm visiting a friend of mine in the hospital.
You don't have to wait until the end.
I rented a boat by the hour.
Which bed do you want to use?
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
I thought it would be fun.
She waited for him for two hours.
Come off it!
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
I know you're telling the truth.
You're very wise.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
What time does this train reach Yokohama?
Had I known you'd be here, I wouldn't have come.
Is it broken?
Have you read the FAQ?
To tell the truth, I drove my father's car without his permission.
I'm doing my homework.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
We're a good team.
I do want to be your friend.
You don't seem too worried.
She ran as fast as possible.
Tom is pretty sure everything will go well.
Have they spotted you?
What a clever idea!
They announced that a storm was coming.
There is nothing the matter with the motor.
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
I think we're getting close.
Are we alone?
I'm one of your students.
Don't do anything you might regret.
He didn't dare say anything.
I'm not talking to you, Tom.
Tom is learning programming.
Don't touch the button.
What's Japan's longest river?
I just want to look at it, that's all.
I built it.
Tom will be here any minute now.
I'm invited to a party tonight.
Let's play some video games to kill time.
I'd like to study French, but I don't have the time.
Don't ask too many questions.
I need that information as soon as possible.
Where's the phone?
He was jailed on trumped-up charges.
I'd like to talk with you.
Nobody likes you.
I wish you had come with us.
I was just leaving home then.
I believe we can get that done.
Is it something you can get rid of?
You're charming.
It is none the less true.
The lawyer asked the judge to make allowance for the age of the accused.
He kept silent during the meal.
I'm not suggesting anything.
I can't go any further.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
Who do you want to talk to?
A field of grass can be quite beautiful.
The wind is blowing very hard.
Which browser are you using?
I've experienced the same thing.
Tom is an experienced dental assistant.
Get to the point.
They're really ugly.
What does that word mean?
I truly hope not.
Their habitat is threatened by deforestation.
Yesterday, I bought a book.
Tom left the door unlocked.
Have you had dinner already?
He painted the ceiling blue.
I'll jump in.
I'm not giving you any money.
You didn't give us much choice.
I just don't feel that way about you.
The banks are closed today.
Be careful crossing the street.
Close your eyes again.
I want to see more.
Would you mind coming with me?
Tell Tom that I need his help.
Anything can happen.
You've got to be bold!
You're under investigation.
I was very unlucky.
Did you come here by train or by bus?
He's a hunk.
I could have you arrested.
I enjoy it more each time.
Drop your gun!
She shot him.
I want to get my ears pierced.
I enjoyed this book.
Say hello to your sister for me.
Could you kill someone?
Why don't you quit?
He cannot be trusted.
Sooner or later, I'll probably visit Boston.
The box is too heavy to carry.
I asked my father to buy this toy.
This table is made out of wood.
I really do have to get back to work.
We are having a serious talk about your future.
You are very early this morning.
Everybody was jealous of my success.
I thought you'd want to know.
This website is very useful.
You won't be interested.
Are you sure we've never met before?
I don't know why you didn't tell me immediately.
She got very angry with the children.
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
You are a student.
I wonder if that was the point.
She liked that.
I want you to be prepared.
I just keep finding excuses.
No wonder they turned down her offer.
She sat next to me.
Everyone started clapping.
I was expecting the worst.
He made an important scientific discovery.
There may be others.
I don't think I could ever do that.
He's old and crazy.
Don't let this chance slip by.
They've had plenty of time.
We are apt to make mistakes.
All the money put together still won't be enough.
I just couldn't go through with it.
It seems that the only time he isn't eating is when he's sleeping.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I don't know that yet.
She has seen better days.
I can't stop myself.
You can drive a car, can't you?
How did you kill the guards?
Everything that you say may be used against you.
She died.
The old man starved to death.
Tom made a list of what he needed.
You should kick that bad habit.
I must be getting close.
Tell me how you did it.
A book not worth reading is not worth buying in the first place.
The mail can't be delivered.
I don't feel like playing either.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
No one cares.
I apologized for having been late for school.
We became best friends.
She avoided answering my questions.
I just couldn't stay away.
Men and women went into battle.
I sold it for ten dollars.
The music stopped.
I feel giddy.
He must be over fifty.
I have no food.
Tom left the lights on all night.
My mother happened to be there when the fire broke out.
How long may I keep this?
You won't drown if you learn how to swim.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Tom almost drowned.
Were you conscientious?
My father is busy as a bee every day.
Do you understand me?
There's no point in asking me for money.
The Colombian government demanded more money.
Tom tried to leave.
I'm visiting my grandmother in the hospital.
Not everyone is honest.
It's not that complicated.
Tom hopes he doesn't become a workaholic like his father.
Do you feel up for a game of chess?
I tried to explain to him that we were not responsible for his mistake, but he refused to listen.
I appreciate what you did earlier.
He's a big coward.
We have a signed agreement.
I think I understood.
Many people don't know that antibiotics are ineffective against viral diseases.
I was disappointed with your paper.
I forgot to ask your name.
I can't answer that.
I just don't like football.
Tom wasn't the first person here.
She went to bed early.
He got the job.
Do you remember what you were watching?
You'll never be able to keep it a secret.
I need to change my tires.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
I didn't know how to express myself.
I can't do that.
Your criticism is unfair.
Art is not a luxury, but a necessity.
This bag is too heavy.
I withdrew my application.
Please open the package.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
Tom was the only one who was hurt.
Tom is a bit paranoid.
Have we met before?
I want to know how much time Tom spent doing that.
The bike screeched to a stop.
She married a local boy.
I borrowed it.
How long will the train stop here?
They live on the floor below.
I have had it.
You don't need to hurry. Take your time.
Cars took the place of bicycles.
Stay in bed.
We are staying at our uncle's.
Don't be afraid to make mistakes when speaking English.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
She got him to drive.
Tom's been going through a rough patch lately.
Keep trying.
I'll be happy to help you.
It's hard to keep up with his dirty deeds.
Tom began fixing dinner.
To make a long story short, everything went fine.
Are you working?
I'll be there tomorrow.
I am afraid of dying.
I could've married Tom.
I've got a class in a few minutes.
We wish you luck.
Please write down your name.
I already told you.
What season do you like the best?
It is the price they pay for their years of over-eating.
Can I have this orange?
How fast does this thing go?
Do you plan to buy that car?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Tom offered to help Mary move.
Can you stay and watch the children?
Why is he busy?
It looks like Tom doesn't really want this job.
I'll sue you.
He is very talented.
Do you still need me?
I don't want us to get caught.
It was good enough.
What's the last thing you remember?
I saw the cake you made.
How do you intend to fix this?
What kind of clothes do you usually wear to school?
The city fell to the enemy.
My fuel line broke.
Not everyone got along.
I'll leave it up to you.
I hope Tom will be very happy.
I want to spend all my time with you.
I asked her to go to a movie with me.
My father is busy as a bee every day.
I respect your opinion.
He suddenly stopped talking.
Don't use that word.
We were sailing.
I consider watching television a waste of time.
The surgeon amputated the wrong leg.
I don't wear chapstick.
Tie your shoe.
You're going to have to call Tom.
The washing machine is a wonderful invention.
She scolded him for being late.
The stars are shining.
I've never made this kind of mistake before.
He is earning twice my salary.
The lamp was suspended from the branch of a tree.
You'll understand it right away.
Let's go ahead and eat.
Don't let him take advantage of you.
We're going to need your help after all.
There were three survivors.
I found that there was a little girl sobbing.
Who fell?
His name is known to everybody in this country.
We're keeping all options open at this point.
Diamonds are forever.
You didn't tell him anything?
We mustn't waste our energy resources.
This dress suits you well.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
There's no cure.
He stayed in London for a time.
The job is not suitable for young girls.
I'd like to look like Tom.
She's usually home on Sundays.
I hope we can avoid that.
I'll forgive you.
Thank you for helping me.
I think Tom didn't understand you.
I saw you.
Could I have some coffee, please?
Long time, no see.
It's all your own fault.
I'm working here.
Is that what you wanted to talk about?
I'm engaged.
I had no place else to go.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
Don't take any chances.
Are you afraid of the dark?
I paid $200 in taxes.
At last, we got to the lake.
I understood it perfectly.
I couldn't make him understand my English.
His way of speaking annoys me.
I don't speak Japanese.
What choice do we have?
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
I like each of them.
I'd be very grateful if you could help me.
It reminded me of you.
There's a lot on the line.
Have you checked the engine?
I felt a little dizzy.
I don't feel like eating sushi.
I stopped drinking coffee.
I am very sorry to inform you that she died.
Tom is confused and scared.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
He married my sister.
You're not supposed to be here.
Were you shot?
Please be honest.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Daddy, let's make faces at each other and see who can keep from laughing the longest.
She wore heart-shaped earrings.
Don't make me beg.
I couldn't sleep.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
I take a walk every morning.
You're grumpy.
She treated him very well.
It will not be long before spring comes.
I am better.
I was really scared.
This book is written in French.
Stop that now.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
Was she able to write a report?
You look positively ghastly.
Are you sure it was Tom?
You're pulling my leg.
He dozed off in history class.
I asked her to marry me and she accepted.
You're reliable.
I had little choice.
You look very tired.
She took my hand.
A hideous monster used to live there.
Do your very best.
I felt threatened.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
Tom danced.
Where are we now?
I thought you'd been killed. I'm glad I was wrong.
Do you have a pen?
You have to choose your own path.
I continued reading.
I can't find anything.
How long does it take?
Is she your only daughter?
Of the 23 who were arrested, four escaped.
We have a little problem.
Eat everything.
We were told to stop doing that.
Nothing happened to Tom.
She was kind enough.
Cold this morning, isn't it?
I'll be careful.
They said it's OK.
Tom isn't used to speaking in public.
Make a list.
She is as tall as you.
She's been feeling a little on edge recently.
She thought that I was the doctor.
Let's say that you're right.
If for some reason a man stopped thinking, that man would no longer be a man.
I promise I won't do this again.
There was a suggestion that the general meeting should take place in October.
That last round of chemo really sapped his energy.
They armed themselves with rifles.
We can't do this without you.
Who are you talking about?
He sounds angry.
I broke up with Tom.
Let me handle it.
That's embarrassing.
He takes the attitude that resistance is a waste of energy.
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
CEO's of American corporations are paid several times their Japanese counterparts.
Tom showed Mary his stamp collection.
I need to sleep.
It's not natural for a mother to outlive her child.
Tom hates school.
Tom seems very distant today.
I feel honored.
What are you sitting on?
If you push the button, the engine will stop.
Are you upset?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom is wearing the sunglasses he bought yesterday.
I don't know if Tom still lives in Boston.
She went to the station to see him off.
He chose his words carefully.
You made a big mistake.
I want you to come and get me.
Where do they come from?
Tom was shot in the leg.
She advised him to keep his promises.
I'd like to make it clear that I will not change my mind.
We have to talk about this.
I'm not sure that that's true.
Don't push me.
It has been snowing for two days.
You're all done.
Tom is definitely feeling better today.
Tom was looking at a map of the area.
What are you watching?
She suggested that I give it to him right away.
He just naturally avoids everything that is intense, difficult or strenuous.
I love a happy ending.
I will deal with him myself.
My sister, wearing her favorite red coat, went out today.
I tried to do that, but I couldn't.
We organized a project team.
It's a small price to pay.
Social networking sites are all the rage now.
Are you afraid of death?
I'd rather stay home if it's all the same to you.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Each time I see Mary, I learn something new and important from her.
How do you read this kanji?
I really loved working here.
She was eager to go home.
Do you think that's a coincidence?
Tom was offended by what Mary said.
I thought you were bluffing.
I took Highway 58.
How long have you been a teacher?
She gave me a fake phone number.
That's not where I'm going.
You don't have to explain.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.
I didn't think you were needed.
Thanks for coming.
I can take a message.
Biting your fingernails is a bad habit.
I'll wait here.
Australia is no different.
The fact was of interest to the scientists.
His words rendered me speechless.
She hit me on the head with a hammer.
I always wanted to be different.
Doesn't that smell great?
The street is wet.
I don't have a very good dictionary.
Aren't your forgetting something?
Reading is one of life's great pleasures.
Don't let your mother know that.
I could hear everything.
I was really hungry.
It's the correct answer.
We took a walk along the river.
I'm here as a tourist.
You have no right to go there.
What was the weather report?
Aiding and abetting the enemy is considered treason.
Everyone is happy.
I think you're going to find this interesting.
You're nuts!
He will be contacting you directly.
You didn't buy that, did you?
Open the bottle.
Pick a number.
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
You must be very proud of your son.
Don't leave me behind!
I can't believe I'm here again.
You were there, too.
Have a look.
Nobody was interested.
The instant he opened the door, he smelt something burning.
I can show you the pictures.
Fortunately, the weather was good.
Have you told anybody?
Your fly is open!
She kissed me, not him.
I've never ridden a horse.
Show him how to do this.
She was too proud to ask him for help.
May I have the menu, please?
The first step is the hardest.
I hear someone singing.
The hounds flushed the fox out of its hiding place.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
I'm not overweight.
Too many sweets make you fat.
He got away.
You said you were busy.
I think we should stick together.
There's dust on the table.
You're the oldest.
We're doing all we can.
Are you lonely?
Seeing that it is 8 o'clock, I think you should leave for school soon.
Tom died when he was 97.
Wind the clock.
A teacher should never make fun of a student who makes a mistake.
That's not surprising.
Is my answer correct?
She gave me a bag made of leather.
She does not speak English as fluently as you.
I have been busy for two days.
I doubt that our new boss will be any worse than the old one.
I want you out of here right now.
He remembered that Room 418, a very small room, was empty.
I think perhaps I can help Tom.
Where are your credit cards?
Maybe I'll call you.
We love each other.
I want to see what there is inside.
I'm looking for a French penpal.
He gives me a bad time, as he always does.
Are you vegetarian?
I never stay anywhere long enough to make friends.
I hope we can fix that.
What did he do after that?
I'm OK.
Let's eat lunch outside.
Why didn't she help you?
Have you ever tried it?
Do you carry weapons?
I'm hungover.
I cried a lot.
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
Who is your favorite author?
I want you to know what's true and what's not.
We're ruined.
Would you like to eat something?
This was easy.
I swallowed a bug.
I wonder why I'm so sleepy.
I thought you were injured.
When did you see him last?
Why is everyone looking at me?
She has had quite a lot to drink.
Which of you came here first?
Do you know who he was?
I don't believe that Tom can speak French.
I'll get this.
My sister was robbed of her bag on her way home last night.
How many proverbs have we learned so far?
Here's your order.
How much should they get?
My father might be at home now.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
He doesn't want to play with his toys.
Everybody started talking at once.
I thought the show was over.
What do you think this sentence means?
We want it back.
I taught my wife how to drive.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
Tom wants to stay.
Can you lift this stone?
That kind of thing can happen when you're in a hurry.
I can only import GIF files.
Are you good at cooking?
He was very kind to them.
She calmed down.
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
What made you change your mind all of a sudden?
Don't take me seriously. I'm only joking.
Someone must have taken my umbrella by mistake.
Tom should do as Mary suggests.
Did anyone visit me during my absence?
You'd better see a doctor.
I'm not as young as I used to be.
You can't deny that.
How much is the express?
Put that book aside for me.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
As he gets older, he's getting more and more stubborn.
How many times a week do you eat out?
That wasn't Tom's choice.
Tom is a very good guitarist, isn't he?
Tom came here to study French.
He will be a good teacher.
Tom is quiet.
I'll recommend it.
This book is worth reading again.
He loses his temper easily.
Scorpions are dangerous.
I'm realistic.
They abandoned the plan.
She gave me several books.
I looked at the picture.
Take care of yourself. Don't get sick.
In my opinion, he's right.
Most of the shops were closed.
Which one will they choose?
He wore glasses.
He shook his son by the shoulder.
You may not like this book.
I wasn't expecting Tom to be there.
The train station will be closed from tomorrow.
Did you kill Tom?
It is up to me to tell the sad news to her.
Are you ready to go?
Help yourself, please.
Thanks for adding me as a friend.
You should take care of your sick mother.
Somebody left the lights on.
I'm a teacher.
Does anyone know the name of the deceased?
I saw many people who had no clothes and I saw many clothes which had no people in them.
Tom has his own room.
Her name was unknown.
He has learned to be patient.
Tom looked really uncomfortable.
You don't have to apologize.
I made reservations.
The old man wanders from town to town peddling his wares.
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
I respect you more than anyone.
Why don't you let us go?
You aren't looking.
I wasn't home.
She bought him a sweater, but he hated the color.
I prefer spring to autumn.
When does it end?
I need to press the button.
I've got plans for you.
Someone ate all the cookies.
It is not as good as it looks.
What was it that you gave him?
I hope you're well rested.
How do you know which one is yours?
Make your bed.
I have your diary.
You're tough.
Check, please.
Tom knows he's not going to win.
You have overstepped your authority.
I used to think that only bears hibernate, but the teacher said that turtles do as well.
It's disconcerting.
All at once, he spoke out.
Have you finished the work yet?
She lives in quite a big mansion.
My father gave a nice watch to me.
It is very kind of you to come and see me.
I think about him often.
Why did Tom want it?
I gave some of my old clothes to the Salvation Army.
He is staying with his relatives.
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
There is no escape.
I have nothing to say with regard to that problem.
Going back to South Africa had stirred up some painful memories for him.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
I'm just a little busy right now.
I thought this was mine.
They're cold.
She earns half as much money as her husband.
Nobody showed up today.
You can stay only if you are quiet.
Your problems are similar to mine.
Don't drink the water.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
I spend at least three hours a week studying French.
Did you question them?
He came to my rescue.
Glass is breakable.
Tom's unarmed.
Don't burst my bubble.
Tom doesn't like the color of the walls in his bedroom.
You can't smoke here.
Let's not rule anything out.
What time is dinner served?
You're psychic.
I like to feed the pigeons.
I thought the company had sent Tom to Boston.
In their case, it was love at first sight.
They're all fake.
The United States borders Canada.
Tom is now older and wiser.
I can't understand what you said at all.
It would mean a great deal to me if you would stay.
I need to travel.
Turn the lights out now.
I remember the first time we met.
Don't let this get out of control.
I saw the boy in brown shoes.
I'll keep that book for myself.
He is a psychic.
While I was waiting for the bus, I saw a traffic accident.
That wouldn't be a good idea.
I hear that you are having an unusually cold winter.
My computer's acting up.
How do you not understand?
I think you might like it.
My little brother is watching TV.
She advised him to do more exercise.
The door blew open.
I don't think I can eat this.
Meeting girls is hard.
He was egging an innocent young man on to join him in his crooked deal.
Can't this boat go any faster?
You can't have both books.
I am looking for my brother.
I am thinking of going to the mountains.
My girlfriend was crying.
Driving relaxes me.
She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer.
I love to play golf.
I parked on the left side of the street just in front of the school.
We have to be prepared to cope with violent storms.
You missed a spot.
I can't help you do that.
I heard someone calling me from a distance.
The weather forecast is not necessarily reliable.
If you're tired, rest.
It doesn't matter whether you come or not.
We went aboard the plane.
There's a fire in the building. We have to evacuate immediately.
He touched me.
He didn't succeed in explaining what he wanted.
It was not my intention.
Let us do our job.
What else do you know?
Do you know what time they came?
No one knows me like you do.
I'm still not sure I can do that.
I was outside when it happened.
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
His speech made no sense to me.
Let's hope he's all right.
That's why I sent for you.
He complains of not having enough time to read.
Keep the door closed.
The hikers were all but frozen when they were found.
You may or may not win.
God made the universe.
You're incredible.
What do you think happens then?
Don't open the present yet.
Everyone was shocked.
I had intended to go abroad.
Tom caught a big fish.
You'd better hand that over.
Sooner or later, his luck will run out.
Lesson Three is hard.
I have an interest in cello and piano.
You look fabulous.
Nice timing.
He doesn't want you to lose a whole week.
What a prospect!
She knows more than she's letting on.
What is my room number?
Your work is below average.
Why did you paint this wall black?
Don't cross this bridge.
I see what you did there.
It's still not right.
It is good for your health to take a walk every morning.
This is all so complicated.
You'll find a solution, I'm sure.
It's good training.
We live in a big city.
The students applauded.
We've all read that one.
I can come back another time.
Among the five of us, she, without a doubt, speaks the most languages.
Nobody was home.
How may I help you?
Try not to cry.
He impressed me with his magic tricks.
Keep looking.
There are a lot of places to see around here.
Nothing is forgiven.
I thought I'd find you here.
Do you mind if I tag along?
We have to be careful.
I don't like scary movies.
I think we should talk.
You can go to the station by bus.
Do you know how to count to ten in French?
You're disgusting.
Tom has my book.
I had a dreadful dream last night.
He plays the piano very well.
This house and this land are mine.
What do you call that contraption?
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
The blossoms will be out in a few days.
I don't remember anything happening.
I want this dog.
My mother is a teacher, too.
I'm running out of ideas.
Tom played the violin.
He stood behind me.
He made sure nobody could see her.
Can you handle it?
That's what Tom would do.
We're sad.
You're not going, are you?
I don't want to buy it if I don't need it.
He might have missed the last train.
We can continue playing, as long as we don't make too much noise.
I'll reconsider the matter.
Tom is waiting for you.
You were hurt, weren't you?
This price is reasonable.
We walked more quickly than usual.
That would be a waste of her talent.
No one's going to sing here tonight.
Is your father a doctor?
You can go to the station by bus.
She gave her entire life to the study of physics.
The cops want you.
No matter how hard you try, the result will be the same.
Can his story be true?
May I bother you for a moment?
I'd like a raise.
You are unbelievably naive.
Do you know why?
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same thing.
I took my shoes off.
When she was three years old, her father died.
I failed to recall the song's title.
Stay here all night if you want.
Could you please sharpen these knives?
He is used to traveling.
Many cities were destroyed by bombs.
Tom has lots of friends in Boston.
My three-year-old niece kissed me on the cheek.
What did you make?
I had to defend myself.
We want a new carpet.
I want to get rid of it.
You're not listening to me.
I mean what I say.
Her life is in danger.
You were Tom's only friend.
Tom doesn't have a TV at home.
May I eat this bread?
Look again.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
Do you know which book sells well now?
Don't you tell me to relax.
Have you tried it?
You need to grow up.
So long.
He was not allowed to remain silent.
She carried off all the prizes.
There's no reason to change our plans.
The deadline is approaching.
He doesn't want to get out of bed.
He's here to protect you.
Are you a student here?
Be watchful.
What if you're wrong?
I'm going to buy some bread.
The population of New York is smaller than that of Tokyo.
Do I need to get the manager?
I know someone needs to tell Tom about Mary's death. Does it have to be me?
I have no one to talk to.
I thought it was stupid.
Photography is an expensive hobby.
Do you realize that?
A number of cars are parked in front of my house.
She is helping him.
Start reading where you left off.
I thought that you wanted to go with us.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
That's not going to stop me.
Tom is a member of the SWAT team.
Tom should've invited Mary.
The old man died last week.
I'm early.
I hope we didn't wake you.
The driver felt like taking a rest.
At what time did he leave?
What did you do this summer?
You shouldn't read in such poor light.
Take off your clothes.
I forgot my jacket.
Everybody knows that.
Do I look busy to you?
He graduated from Tokyo University.
I wonder which of you will win.
Do you like singing?
I don't have one.
Did your mother make those?
He got angry.
You may need this.
There's no need for you to study.
Are you sure it was Tom?
I'm not going to show you this.
Tom's password was easy to guess.
When the chips are down, the only one you can count on is yourself.
I hope to continue to see more of the world.
Go away before they see you here.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
I suggest you leave immediately.
I don't know what that is.
Isn't there anything that will make you feel better?
I've never seen two people so much in love as Tom and Mary.
She has never gone abroad.
Please be kind to others.
We all breathed a sigh of relief.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
I won't do anything.
Will you stay at home tonight?
That wouldn't be any fun.
Mother made me a new suit.
I will need your help.
You never stop, do you?
Is it a direct flight?
May I go home now?
The three were arrested.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I wanted to run away with Tom.
You guys look lost.
I couldn't stop laughing.
We can't waste even a minute.
What kind of car were they driving?
I grew up in Australia.
I paid in cash.
I want you to play the guitar for me.
Tom searched the entire house.
It sounds like a good plan.
She took him for all his money.
I don't belong here.
Give it to whoever needs it.
She was wearing long boots.
I know you're not scared.
Over 4 million Australians communicate in a language other than English.
He occupies a prominent position in the firm.
Do you understand or not?
Let's go and swim in the river.
She has small feet.
Tom is driving without a license.
I am playing video games.
Tom wants to play.
What scared you?
Please help yourself to the salad.
He'll make a good husband.
Forward this to everyone you know.
We'll go to any length to send our child to a good university.
Can we leave?
It is this window that he broke.
Let's stop this argument.
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
The situation there was critical.
Mary helped Tom.
Tom doesn't really understand how I feel.
Are you proud of yourself?
The dress in the window caught my eye.
Do you think in French?
How did I get into this?
It's very good.
I will always be there for you.
He's rich, but he's not happy.
She had hardly begun to read the book before someone knocked at the door.
I thought I'd always be alone.
She screamed for help.
I talked to her for an hour.
Everything I did, I did for Tom.
He sang some old songs.
Isn't it the other way around?
Stock prices declined for five consecutive days.
I like the color of your shirt.
She has brown eyes.
It's the sort of work that calls for a high level of concentration.
We don't have much more time.
We have no reason to change our plans.
Your house is nicer than mine.
Don't wait up.
The cat is very cute.
A fire broke out on the second floor.
We are at war.
We booked seats for the play.
I want to have something to remember you by.
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
Call me if you want to do something together tomorrow.
He doesn't need to work.
I can't be seen with you.
He has half as many books as I do.
What's that building?
He'll help you if you ask.
I just got a call from my office.
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
They wake up at six every morning.
I have a prior engagement.
Let's leave the decision to our teacher.
The coat doesn't have any pockets.
Even though Tom used to be my best friend, I'm beginning to hate him.
We acted in good faith.
How old were you when you first did that?
You should have kept it secret.
I want you to leave me alone.
I don't think we can really say that one is right and the other is wrong.
The situation has deteriorated.
His grades have improved significantly.
I gave him a warning, to which he paid no attention.
I just want to talk to them.
He will be waiting for you about two o'clock.
Let's go now.
I love performing.
The building collapsed in the earthquake.
Feel free to ask any questions.
Tom spent the night in the small cabin near the lake.
He was nearly drowned.
Nice seeing you!
Doctors thought he had a cold.
He was paroled after having served eleven years of his sentence.
I need to show you something.
I went to the post office.
We're like brothers.
I want to make my father proud.
Who would you like to speak to?
In front of the university, there are some bookstores.
Children should play outside.
They have already begun.
He devoted a lot of time to study.
Give him a hug.
The nurse gave you a sedative.
I'd rather do this by myself.
I think it's worth the risk.
In the United States, it takes a minimum of eight years of college to become a medical doctor.
I can hardly hear you.
Thank you for your kind words.
You may as well leave at once.
Are you enjoying yourself?
"Are you hungry?" "No, not really."
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him.
Tom avoided the question.
Tom is always here.
Do you read Tom's blog?
It scared the daylights out of him.
I saw an exciting baseball game last Saturday.
My father encouraged me to learn how to play the piano.
You can't keep talking to me like this.
That's why I'm here.
I agreed to help him in his work.
That was a problem.
I thought it sounded like a good idea.
Do you know that hotel?
I don't feel safe here.
I can't believe this is happening.
Why don't you ride with me?
I'm not angry at you, just very disappointed.
What do you want to do today?
How are you connected?
They were better than I expected.
Only 514 people have been in space.
I just didn't want you to worry.
Native Americans fought with bow and arrow.
That's not how I want things to be.
Are we going far?
It rained all day yesterday.
The examples in this dictionary are easy to understand.
I know all I need to know.
I don't know who's involved.
Can you take the lid off this box?
I have seen him many times.
He drinks too much alcohol.
I believe the choice is clear.
Does he do any sports?
We can't get close to the enemy.
The loneliness and drabness of working away from people are fatal to his best effort.
I can't tell you who we are.
She's a successful businesswoman.
You were the one who gave this to me.
The book is mine.
They were different.
How would you analyze the situation?
He is our teacher and a person we should respect.
Don't make a fuss.
I want to play, too.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
Do Martians speak English?
It's been a long time since I had such a pleasant surprise.
I made up my mind to go there.
Tom asked me who that man was.
I was going to work.
Your threats don't scare me at all.
