Shouldn't you overlook his indiscretions and forgive him?
Love is not a crime.
"Who helped you?" "Tom did."
She's inquisitive by nature.
I'm just writing a letter to my girlfriend.
I think it's a great idea.
The toilet is upstairs.
And while I'm at it, I have another question.
I want to please you.
She agreed with him on what to do with the old car.
Don't hesitate to ask a question if you don't understand.
We want more food.
We're competitors, not partners.
I hope this isn't a dream.
He stopped drinking.
Can you tell me who they are?
You can't be serious.
Is there something in particular that you want to drink?
Do you know what your kids are eating?
I figured you'd be here.
Tom talked with Mary yesterday.
Tom fell off the chair.
He asked her questions.
I don't feel like laughing.
Will you have another slice of pie?
Many people believe that money brings happiness.
You have blood on your hands.
That's not what we want.
What did you think of him?
You're very direct.
Have you eaten supper yet?
Don't make me blush.
We're conservative.
They made fun of my clothes.
He doesn't live there anymore.
Do they know that we know?
If he had been free, he would have gone fishing.
Are there any cute girls in your class?
You should always wash your hands before meals.
They told me about it.
I hope my new stepfather sticks around longer than the last one.
I think Tom is generous.
I don't like being controlled.
The statue has no head.
We realize that.
I can see just as well as you can.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
I'm breaking up with my girlfriend tonight.
How can I tell if I'm really in love?
Do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
It was very funny.
I've never met a man as stupid as you.
My joints ache when it gets cold.
He was more than a king.
This box contains five apples.
I carelessly dropped a vase.
I should've paid a little more attention.
When did you get married?
You do that and I'll fire you.
She told him that she was sad.
Tom leaned on the counter.
You'd better go to bed at once.
Tom admitted that he was scared.
I don't know what to call you.
I prefer to read.
I hurt myself today.
What did you want to show me?
I know a man who can speak Russian well.
Factories were producing more than ever before.
You don't need to go there.
She doesn't hate him. In fact, she loves him.
How did he know my name?
Read as much as possible.
Here's the money I owe you.
I owe my success to you.
I need someone to hold me and tell me everything will be alright.
Where can they be?
You don't need to wait.
If you have any doubts, let me know without any hesitation.
You can't leave me now.
I am taller.
I knew you liked me even though you never showed it.
Take a break.
Come play with us.
We miss you a lot.
Anyone could do that.
Tom will be angry if Mary does that.
She is powerful.
He went there in person.
Tom is one of nicest guys I know.
The audience looked bored.
Don't you have work today?
Since there were no taxis, I had to walk.
You hurt my feelings.
They say amniotic fluid has roughly the same composition as sea water.
You can do that.
We're just nervous.
I have seen "Star Wars" twice.
I talked to Tom about what happened.
Let's spend less time arguing and more time working.
I was very flattered.
Tom won't let you go.
It's a pity they're getting divorced.
There aren't as many trains at night.
Tom told us that he had a headache.
He received quite a few letters this morning.
I think Tom could be persuaded to help.
He wrote the report.
See what happens when you give people advice?
I did something similar.
She lives in an apartment alone.
I thought you'd be older.
How did you do this?
Don't count on his help.
There were no taxis available.
She managed to scare off her attacker by screaming loudly.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
Do you have what I asked for?
Did you have breakfast?
I am grateful to you for your kindness.
You know what you have to do.
Don't you ever touch me again.
May I say something?
I love both cats and dogs.
Did you have fun tonight?
I hate my computer.
Where was this picture taken?
She declined the invitation.
Bring me today's paper, please.
That's not your knife.
It looks like she's got a lot of friends.
You must be careful not to make him angry.
Are you still afraid?
I need more gold.
Should I start?
This and no more.
I live in this hotel.
They are jealous of our success.
I wasn't born yesterday.
I think Tom didn't understand what you were saying.
We decided to leave him alone for a while.
I'm going to prison.
There is a line at the ticket office.
I spent hours looking for the key that I had dropped.
I don't often get invited to parties.
I canceled it.
I'll show you around the city.
I had a nagging sensation that I'd seen him somewhere before.
I'd like to read some books about the Beatles.
Where were you?
I advise you to change clothes.
I study French in addition to English.
I need to go home.
All the seats are occupied.
I have so many things I want you to know.
You don't want to tell me why, do you?
Let's go by taxi, OK?
Tom doesn't have the will power to quit smoking.
Am I boring you?
His car was seriously damaged.
Which one do you like better?
Is it dangerous?
I feel old.
It reads like a fairy tale.
You're demented.
Do you have psychic powers?
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
You should stop drinking.
I don't like your attitude.
We've been talking about you.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
I rented out the guest bedroom.
Keep listening.
Everything comes to those who wait.
The teacher made him stay after school.
Tom doesn't have a dad.
Tom is too stubborn to apologize.
He kept us waiting for more than an hour.
You're the last person I expected to see here.
The winters were bitterly cold.
Take this medicine after each meal.
Try to remain calm.
That's what happens 99% of the time.
I have amnesia.
I think I'll take a look around.
I have to go to a meeting.
It was a great blow to us.
It looks really good.
I didn't want to disturb Tom.
Is this why you've come back?
I want to know if my baggage is going to arrive.
I love hard-boiled eggs.
I'll see to it that you get a raise after the first year.
He is about forty.
You have to accept your role.
Have you tried that before?
The typhoon gathered strength.
What's your name?
Don't tell Tom anything.
Leave us.
My father doesn't lift a finger at home.
I've tried to explain it to Tom.
You have good taste in music.
Do it somewhere else.
Tom knew that Mary loved John.
You can borrow an umbrella if you need one.
You're not the only neurosurgeon here.
I sure miss my friends.
The machine is out of order.
They'll eat those.
He gives plain, simple explanations.
Be careful what you wish for.
I wanted your opinion.
Could you give me a leg up here?
Tom has a secret weapon.
I promised I'd tell you the truth.
Tom loves sports events.
You did that.
When did you get married?
We're all angry.
This is astounding.
Come with me, please.
The victim declined to press charges.
In my opinion, you are wrong.
I am not sure whether I will be able to come with you.
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
The light went on.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
Do you have a shoehorn?
I want to live in a world where people love one another.
I found her cat in an empty room.
Don't change your mind so often.
I want to be with you more than anything.
I ordered the book from Britain.
You don't have to read the whole thing from beginning to end.
I was hurt by many people.
What she says sounds strange.
Tom takes himself too seriously.
Who is your teacher?
You're very brave.
Tom didn't want me to sell my old truck.
I'm uncomfortable.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
I can't fall asleep.
The bus was almost empty.
Everyone was silent for a minute.
This is an old letter.
His eyes failed him.
We're pretty tight.
I'm a farmer.
I just don't know what to do.
I'll answer all your questions.
He suddenly stopped.
Tom's body has been cremated.
What really surprised me most was that I was the only one who got fired.
The snowstorm continued.
He had to go through a lot of hardships.
Did you just realize that?
I thought you would understand.
Tom lived in Boston before, right?
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
She took my joke seriously.
You are lying.
It was obvious to everybody that he was tired.
Why didn't you run?
Tom climbed down the ladder.
He held the trophy up high.
I owe you a big apology.
He is fond of painting.
You can't hurt me any more than you already have.
Being ill, I stayed at home all day long.
You aren't really going to do that, are you?
How did you learn Esperanto?
You should have gotten up earlier.
A few were drunk most of the time.
Come whenever you want.
She demanded to see the manager.
Who were you talking to?
She cut the cake into six pieces and gave one to each of the children.
Do you really want to go there?
Did you have a nice evening?
I'm trying to figure out what you do for fun.
I noticed that I had slept past my station.
They assigned the task to us.
This is for you, Tom.
That's my fault.
You should not go alone.
We do this all the time.
You're bright.
Is your name on the list?
Choose something.
I was born on June 4, 1974.
What do they want us to do?
I don't quite understand what you are saying.
Bring it here.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
Was it interesting?
I bowed politely.
I figured I'd find you here.
You know who I mean.
I'm beginning to get used to doing this.
Are you really that stupid?
Don't worry. I'll do it.
You've got everything you need.
It's raining again.
He is an angry drunk.
You're all the same.
Are you mad?
I am very sad.
I just thought that you wouldn't want to go.
We followed orders.
Tom gave me back my dictionary.
Back off.
I'm untalented.
I think I left something in the classroom.
She intended to go shopping with her mother, but her mother was busy.
Weâ€™ve been waiting for hours.
You need a joystick.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Hurry up, or you will be late.
Am I first?
I'm in charge of shopping.
I'm going back inside.
Why are you washing your hands?
Should I take this medicine?
He drives me crazy.
I'd like your permission to use it.
I did it for him.
He refused to pay.
What did the boy say?
My father might be at home now.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
I don't speak English.
Let's continue from where we left off.
Whip the egg-whites until they are stiff.
Don't even think of asking me what I think about you right now.
Absolutely nothing is permanent in life.
The land had never been ploughed.
I should've worn a hat.
We thank you very much!
You look fabulous.
His visits became less frequent as time passed.
None of us can speak French.
Turn on the air conditioner.
Don't bury your head in the sand.
Are you certain about this?
I know that the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
He had no choice but to run away.
I'll talk.
Where exactly are you?
How come you didn't come to the party?
I never for a moment imagined that I would win.
I handled it.
I made a paper plane.
Tom is a shrewd businessman.
He fooled her.
She made some derogatory remarks about her colleagues.
Can I take a picture of you?
I hardly see you anymore.
Tom seems sincere.
The price includes tax.
The match didn't take place.
You are in a safe place.
You're in big trouble.
I think we'd better start over again.
Tom is good at biology.
I didn't think you would come.
I didn't understand the meaning.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Don't worry. I told you everything would be OK.
I have a sweet tooth.
I just can't wait to go to work.
I think it's time for me to consider going on a diet.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus had already left.
They are out shopping.
Can't you ride a bicycle?
I'm not very busy.
You're moody.
She doesn't listen to him.
He's a very nice boy.
The radio warned us of the coming earthquake and we started gathering our things.
Put the flour on the shelf.
I wanted it to be a surprise.
Are they satisfied?
Is lunch ready?
Why don't you quit?
No matter who says so, it's not true.
You look perfect.
I'm sick of fighting.
I've made this mistake before.
How does this work?
Tom walked towards the stairs.
I think our work here is done.
I just want to talk to you.
I urge everyone to do the same.
She studies as hard as ever.
She advised him to go there.
You don't have the time.
Don't leave this room.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
I'd rather be here than in Boston.
I heard you got a new car.
Say which one you would like.
You have no idea how tired I am of all this complaining.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
Tom is getting married next month.
You won't be shot.
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
Stop, or I'll shoot.
We'll all be together.
Tom waited a while.
Most boys like baseball.
Better a broken promise than none at all.
I want them to be your friends.
I've been studying French for three years.
I've got better things to do with my time.
Tom forgot to pay his rent.
I wonder where to hang this picture that Tom gave me.
I wanted to tell you.
It's going to be harder this time.
Why did you want to come back here?
He has money.
I like red wine better than white.
I had a very tight schedule last week, but this week I'm relatively free.
Compared to you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
Tell me what we're doing here.
His car soon went out of sight.
They're all hungry.
The hunter shot a bear.
Remain seated, please.
This building is about to collapse.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
This tea smells good.
They arranged a meeting.
I'm a little curious.
I think we should be allowed to go anywhere we want.
Which is your pen?
You work harder than anyone here.
He has left already.
I no longer want to hurt anyone.
You don't need one now.
I'm sick of your complaints.
Take your shot.
Tom got what he deserved.
Let's make a phone call.
Tom is going to visit Mary tomorrow.
You don't need to go unless you want to.
We had a large audience.
They ate and drank wine.
May I sit here?
My girlfriend often cuts my hair.
The chairman suggested that we should discuss the problem.
I'm so bored right now.
Tom stole it.
You dropped something.
I'm aware of that possibility.
He came in through the window.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
People say that he's still alive.
It is no use asking him again.
I heard what happened at school.
The high-profile kidnapping has captivated the nation.
I heard a noise in the bedroom.
Tom's upstairs.
You're very efficient.
I don't like this tie. Show me a better one.
She argued with him about their children's education.
Are you here to help us?
We're not going home.
It was very painful.
Tom was normally very reliable and his absence from the meeting was inexplicable.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
Eat your spinach.
You should have introduced yourself to the girl.
We all care for one another.
Tomorrow's a holiday.
My back is killing me.
My husband reads the newspaper while eating breakfast.
She is very cynical about life.
I can't stand it any longer.
You're very astute.
What are the terms of the contract?
He wants red glasses.
Tom had no other choice but to help Mary clean out the garage.
That's enough for me.
I saw her swim.
May I be excused?
It was unlocked.
Nobody came to help him.
I have a slight headache now.
Take care of yourselves.
I know what you mean.
Why did they do that?
I cut myself shaving this morning.
All of them are connected.
These simple tips will help you declutter your home.
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
I didn't even know you spoke French.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
Tom doesn't think he'll be able come tomorrow.
Does anyone in your office speak French?
She bought a toy for her child.
Most children love ice cream.
Did you read it all?
I would rather stay at home than go out.
The CEO is trying to quash these unfounded rumors about a merger.
I couldn't catch what he said.
Are you dressed?
He spoke under his breath.
The zoo was closed on Christmas Day.
I wasn't offended by that.
I went aboard.
They are on good terms with each other.
We're counting on you to wake us up in time, so don't fall asleep.
Are they all nuts?
My cat will love this.
I can see the light.
I want to trust you.
I was wondering if you could help me.
I think we should sell our old car.
Did you call him up yesterday?
I'm just as confused as you are.
I'm sure that's not true.
Well, here we go.
I'm very drawn to you.
Have you asked if they want one?
I've never thought about that before.
He knows how to captivate his audience.
She can't stop me.
Mother approved my plan.
We have room for thirty people.
I can drive to Boston and back on one tank of gas.
I couldn't meet him at the station because my car ran out of gas.
You can't keep me here.
A trip to Mars may become possible in my lifetime.
Get your things together.
I've forgotten your number.
He's got what it takes to make it in the business world.
I've always loved you.
Don't you just hate technology?
I feel different today.
I just wanted you to know that.
Tom told me to stay at home.
English is a universal language and is used all over the world.
I'm counting how many people there are.
I'll get used to it.
Please be seated, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
The door remained closed.
Take a deep breath.
We asked him what he was called.
That's old news.
Do you like oysters?
"Are the drinks free?" "Only for the ladies."
I think we can handle that.
The town has changed a lot since then.
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
Hey, where did you two come from?
Why are you waiting?
Her mother has gone shopping.
Please turn it on.
He's here to spy on us.
I had nothing to do with the accident.
You have been warned.
We're too busy.
Do you like cheeseburgers?
That car is his.
Tom was my neighbor for three years.
Tom tried to sleep.
We have faith in Tom.
Tom wants to see Mary in his office.
We canoed downstream.
The roads are slippery, so please be careful.
Things are improving.
Tom is nuts.
That computer might not work.
I hope that you'll help me.
I want to know what you mean.
Tom has lots of money.
No one lives here anymore.
Please write it down.
An accident has just happened.
Ladies first.
I think we should head back.
Crime does not pay.
They mistook my politeness for friendship.
His horse jumped over the fence.
That's not the reason why I said the job wasn't easy.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee.
I'm training for the triathlon.
Are you ready?
He censured me for what I had done.
I'm not your servant.
It's not safe to swim in that river.
We'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't use taxis unless it's absolutely necessary.
I'm sick of fish.
Do you want another one of these?
When I came home, I felt very hungry.
What's a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this?
She's only two years old, but she can already count to 100.
He says it's urgent.
The room is crawling with spiders.
I'm by no means angry with you.
Are you proud of yourself?
The homework is due next week.
Tom and Mary will come at 2:30.
I dislike coffee.
Don't worry. I told you everything would be OK.
He was ashamed of the grades he got.
I rarely talk on the phone.
At a young age, I had to learn to fend for myself.
I had a very hard time writing the paper.
He works all night.
Cricket is a game that takes skill.
I have been expecting you.
Have you ever lived in Boston?
I set myself realistic goals.
What ship were you on?
I want to find out if the warranty has expired yet.
Tom didn't even have enough money to buy a cup of coffee.
The whole thing doesn't make sense.
I have to finish up some things before I go.
I thought you'd be grateful.
That's where I went yesterday.
I don't mind.
He is working as a security guard at a warehouse.
An elephant is a strong animal.
It's poison.
I can't really talk about it.
I'm going to change my shirt.
I need the keys.
I suppose you already know that's my car.
Tom betrayed us.
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
You've taken everything.
Your coat is very beautiful.
I used to wear glasses.
You don't have to go.
I'll demonstrate.
Do what he says.
What were you doing at that time?
I ran into a friend on the bus.
Just do what you want.
We can't trust anyone now.
Tom is in the shower.
Everybody thought so.
Well, it's complicated.
Listen to what I have to say.
I don't know if there is time.
Mom, can Tom stay for dinner?
He was in the shower.
Does that seem strange to you?
I feel like being alone.
That boy is his brother.
Go with the flow.
I feel lonely when you're not here.
You won't go, will you?
We know you're interested.
I asked the butcher to trim all the fat off of the meat.
Don't toy with her affections.
We hold a meeting once a month.
I don't have any problems at all.
They've been damaged.
Take a nap if you're tired.
I don't know why you're all so angry.
It's all your own fault.
He is likely to have a book and a cracker at his meals--and then forget to eat the cracker!
We must look at the problem from a global point of view.
This feels like silk.
It's still not ready.
Isn't that true?
I often recall my happy childhood memories.
What does that have to do with me?
The house stood out because of its unusual shape.
Tom doesn't drive as carefully as I do.
I know that Tom and Mary didn't sing together.
Don't even talk to me.
She just wrote a book.
Tom, you should see this.
This is ugly.
He volunteered to help her.
I don't want to waste my time trying to do this again.
I'll send you a post card from Boston.
Where did you find the key?
Do you know what the population of Boston is?
Don't forget to answer the letter.
I love you both.
I didn't know Tom was here.
I hope you will be completely cured.
I shouldn't be laughing.
I just wanted to say thanks.
I was glad that I could help.
I have to make another call.
Do you think anyone can see me?
That's a pretty name.
You don't have to go there.
There is an urgent need for a more effective method of treating this disease.
I'm already married.
She wanted to get married immediately.
How many people were present at the meeting?
That was no accident.
This is my mother's recipe.
Tom told me he was going to commit suicide.
I want to do some shopping around here.
Tom has shoulder-length hair dyed red.
I owe somebody something.
Do as you want.
I only had a piece of toast and a cup of coffee this morning.
Japan's rice market is closed to imports.
We need help here.
I knew they were coming.
I don't think anybody can help me now.
She always stood by me.
A couple of flights were delayed on account of a minor accident.
If I were you, I wouldn't do it.
They're all gone.
The population of the city is about 100,000.
She never reads.
It is almost ten o'clock.
We all speak French.
I hate rainy days.
Please come as soon as possible.
You knew I was married.
I don't feel so great.
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins.
Do you honestly believe that?
Where would you like to go?
Could you come to tomorrow's meeting?
Her shyness makes me like her even more.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Tom put new pedals on the bicycle that he rides to school.
We're smashed.
I've had enough of this.
It's vibrating.
He would not go out.
Don't confuse the two.
How much does the shirt cost?
He doesn't seem to be an American.
I already did that.
Am I talking too fast?
We hope this never happens again.
The leaves on the tree have turned red.
You aren't my mother.
I can peel an apple.
I'm busy, too.
You're on the list.
Put on your pajamas.
He's a man of many talents.
We were looking for Tom.
She shook her head.
Come play with us.
Everyone loves him.
We debated on the question of world population.
He's on his last legs.
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
Brush your teeth at least twice a day.
The young man put out his hand and I shook it.
Let me buy you a new one.
One of the aircraft's engines cut out.
Will you come back tomorrow?
How much do you want to spend?
How did you get to know her?
Remind him to come home early.
Please don't take this lightly.
I'll pick you up at your home.
I forget your phone number.
I'm not leaving.
I did all I could.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
What a lovely day!
She's a supermodel.
He slept all day.
I support you one hundred percent.
She isn't good enough for him.
Nothing is strange.
We don't share the same values.
They want us to come in right away.
We all like him.
You can't handle it.
Why didn't you call me last night?
I think we're neighbors.
Everyone smiles in the same language.
You're far too young to be doing this.
They're not alone.
Don't tell me you're not scared.
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
We're finished.
You owe me one.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
Don't break my heart.
I quite agree with you.
Have you ever been to New York?
Don't let him sleep.
Do you want me to turn off the lights?
I am poor at tennis.
Our team is winning.
I would've told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
You never have any doubts, do you?
Nobody can keep us apart now.
I thought you were going to fix the sink.
You don't have to apologize.
They had different ideas.
You must always do what is right.
I don't understand this obsession of yours.
It works well.
I have a new girlfriend.
I refuse to believe that we can't do anything about the situation.
I'm not allowed to say anything.
It wasn't my fault.
It takes years to master a foreign language.
I hope you'll both be happy together.
Are you ready to order?
Here is your dog.
You really want to do this, don't you?
We have two daughters and one son.
Would you like to go camping with us next weekend?
Please telephone him.
She cried as she read the letter.
Kyoto is visited by many tourists.
Catch you later.
I hate Sundays.
They told me about it.
Aren't you ashamed of the way you behaved?
They never did what they said they would do.
I make you nervous, don't I?
It's as easy as that.
I just want what's best for you.
I just downloaded a lot of files.
It's phony.
She knows everything about cooking.
I've just eaten some sushi and drunk a beer.
Did you hear my son play the violin?
He took us to the zoo.
Where were you born?
It couldn't have come at a better time.
I thought he would be upset.
Tom has a history of arrests for drunken driving.
I don't have to answer your questions.
My parents made me go there.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
The cat fell asleep curled up in front of the fireplace.
I think I can sing fairly well.
Keep up the good work.
I'm afraid I've run short of coffee.
My younger sister didn't say "hello."
Nice shot!
These apples are big.
What are you going to do for summer vacation?
It fell short of my expectation.
What is it you do?
How did you lose it?
You shouldn't drink this water.
I think it's the best way.
They couldn't agree on anything.
Let's try it with this one.
I believe what you said is true.
This gives me the strength to go on.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
The park is in the center of the city.
How could you know?
You don't know anything.
I hate pretending I'm interested.
I only wanted to be helpful.
I was able to help her.
I'm so tired!
He speaks English with a German accent.
I don't like this hat.
I still have the book from last semester.
What has become of him since then?
Tom believes that Mary is innocent.
Come over to our table.
I was on the spot when he had a heart attack.
I found it difficult to please her.
I really do love your tie.
The job is almost done.
Don't tell anybody.
Tom was your French teacher, wasn't he?
This hall was full of people.
How do you take your coffee?
Can you come?
I'm here with a friend.
I'm the middle child of three.
Do you have a dog?
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
I told her that if I could be of any use I would be glad to help.
He wears pajamas.
The concert was a great success.
Do you think it's just a coincidence?
The Japanese embassy has warned Japanese citizens to be careful.
Bring me a drink.
Would you mind rubbing my feet?
Are you sure that's safe?
I think this is the most impressive building on Park Street.
Everything is all right at home.
After I finished my homework, I watched baseball on TV.
I'm playing with my friends.
Mr. Jackson is our science teacher.
That's all you can do.
You're not married, are you?
You're unbiased.
Computers save us a lot of time and trouble.
It was kind of you to help me.
I won't run away like a coward.
You gave Tom the money he asked for, didn't you?
Don't open it, please.
I knew that someone would come.
I've missed another chance.
This English composition is far from perfect.
I just did what anybody would've done.
She went shopping.
I decided to go out and explore the town.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
They're all bad.
My brother did it on my behalf.
It doesn't work so well because the battery is low.
I'm not sure if Tom does that anymore.
Can you cash this check for me?
I hate it when you do that.
Tom and Mary used to be good friends.
We're comedians.
You need to be more aggressive.
Tom is bilingual.
Reading books is my hobby.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Tom began praying.
That made me very sad.
There is a little wine left in the bottom of the glass.
I'm tough.
We should've bought three bottles of wine.
I'm just following orders.
You won't be interested.
How much thinner do you want to be?
It's not worth the effort.
Tom doesn't need to worry about Mary.
What kind of car do you drive?
You may stay here as long as you like.
The meaning of this sentence is obscure.
I was moved to tears by her speech.
I haven't decided yet whether I'll go to college or get a job.
I can't even remember my own name.
You must do as I say.
The contract is in the bag, so let's go out and celebrate.
I know how they did it.
The boy complained of a headache.
There was no one left but me.
He had to take care of his dog himself.
I am 19 years old.
It's a dead end.
That actress is as beautiful as ever.
Bring me today's paper, please.
You must realize that I can't help you.
We can try.
The kitchen is downstairs.
You can't do anything about that.
This may be your last chance.
We've had a lot of rain this year.
We like playing soccer.
I hate everyone, and everyone hates me.
You never told me that.
You may disagree with me.
You'll never regret this.
I read a lot of novels.
Was it all worth it?
I know what you did.
How long are you planning to stay here?
He will reach Hakodate tonight.
I want you to say you're not going back to Boston.
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday.
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
I hope Tom has fun.
I'm not proud of that.
I refuse to answer the question.
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour.
Don't push this button.
Where's everybody?
I hate to see you so miserable.
There was fear in his eyes.
I don't know what to do next.
I am working hard trying to learn English.
I couldn't find it.
She is two years younger than me.
The summer vacation begins in July.
I slept very well.
How did you spend your free time?
My whole body is sore.
I'm pretty sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
You're not that crazy.
I didn't make the rules.
You should act more calmly.
The rocket ought to have reached the moon by now.
They arrived at the hotel.
I think it's unlikely that the next model will be any better than this one.
It's not a good car, but it's still a car.
Sometimes trying your best just isn't good enough.
His argument was logical.
Is she making a doll?
You're very wise.
Where are your parents?
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.
He needs to be alone.
You get out only what you put in.
Tom's eyelids were half open.
I wear a suit, but not a tie.
Nobody likes you.
You were incompetent.
Tom was all worn out.
Why is that baby crying?
How can they just make up stuff like that?
My parent's house is comfortable.
He looked up at the night sky.
Why are your eyes so big?
We don't have enough information yet to make a decision.
None of the teachers could solve the problem.
Can't you speak French?
Tom ought to stop doing that.
Last night my daughter didn't come home until half past one.
Here we are.
So what were we talking about?
They went surfing.
I just got a call from the hospital.
Don't try to get up yet.
Isn't it a beautiful day?
I don't deserve your friendship.
I love to see you smile.
How about going for a walk after lunch?
I advised him not to drive.
I like being part of this group.
Do you see anything?
He's our only suspect.
They sat in a circle.
When did you quit smoking?
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
He had the kindness to show me the way.
Will you please put the baby to bed?
What is the name of this river?
Tom didn't have time to watch the TV program he wanted to watch.
You could do it if you really wanted to.
Stay out of this.
He dug a hole.
There is a full moon tonight.
I wish you had told me what to do.
This is kind of fun.
You will need a key.
I will go at 10.
I gained three pounds.
Here are the tickets.
I love your sweater.
I do not trust him any longer.
Have you ever lived in Boston?
I'm devastated.
He borrowed a lot of money from the bank.
The voice actors did a excellent job on this movie.
I like to finish what I start.
I'm too tired to think.
I suppressed a yawn.
Trust me on that.
She kissed him on the cheek.
Are you hiring?
Tom is buying a suit.
She told him a joke.
Don't tell me what I already know.
How did Tom blow it?
We're smart.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
What do you think I should pack for my trip?
Does that mean you bought it?
Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to go camping?
Songs and poems were written about him.
I can't go to work in these clothes.
Tom said he didn't drink coffee.
Maybe we should wait until Tom gets here.
Tom's the one who broke the window.
Does Tom talk to you in French?
She trusted you.
He is facing many difficulties.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
Will you have a little time this weekend to help me with my French?
I remember when I first saw you.
The gang is all here.
My friend lives in this house.
Ask her what she bought.
That's pretty big.
Why is it my fault?
Aren't you annoyed by that?
Don't tell me you stole it.
I was dismissed.
If you could come, I'd be really happy.
That no longer matters.
She advised him on that matter.
Tom got there long after we did.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
I can only speak for myself.
You should be more careful the next time.
Everybody in the park looked up at the hot air balloon.
I don't know yet, but I'll find out soon enough.
I've known about this for years.
Tom disappointed me.
You're not allowed to park here.
Tom waited for thirty minutes.
I asked my boss for a pay raise.
I'd help you if I could.
What do you like to do?
The king imposed heavy taxes on the people.
We invited him to our house.
You promised me that you would make something for us to eat.
She said that she was eager to go there.
There was a strong wind on that day.
That never used to bother me.
I'll watch TV.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.
You need to move on.
Who allowed him in?
I trusted my teacher.
I have tried everything.
I don't care about any of that.
This hut is in danger of falling down.
No one is expendable.
I've been wrong.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
The snowstorm raged for a full week.
I no longer want to live in Boston.
It doesn't hurt at all.
I am in the house.
Are you staying for dinner?
Do I have your permission to do so?
I always brush my coat when I come home.
Time flies.
At the next intersection, take a right.
I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.
Do you talk to your plants?
She is cooking for him.
We went to a movie.
I had forgotten all about today's meeting. I'm glad you reminded me.
Can I take a picture here?
We have no alternatives.
What do you like to do in your free time?
I'm not invited to parties.
Do you like the new school better?
I have to study for the test.
Where's the rest of our class?
It is just a year since I got married.
Traveling by boat is a lot of fun.
I don't want you to be upset.
He surprised his opponent.
You had better put on your crash helmet.
We considered the problem from all angles.
He thinks he knows best.
I assume that's what you want.
I have booked a table for four.
This flower is more beautiful than that rose.
I need to know.
I'm totally confused.
Are you through with the newspaper?
That's a heartwarming scene.
Do you remember who I am?
She can't ski.
She hates him.
The early bird catches the worm.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
We closed the restaurant three years ago.
She advised him to go abroad while he was still young.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
I'm impressed with your French.
I can't believe you just did that.
I beg to differ.
Rice grows in warm climates.
How do you know it's true?
Walking along the street, I found a wallet.
What do you think happens then?
Comb your hair before you go out.
I'm really not hungry.
I can trace my ancestors back 200 years.
Will you still be here this afternoon?
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
She wrote to him to tell him that she loved him.
Slow down.
Where did this one come from?
He was the one who suggested it.
I'm too busy to help Tom.
She kept working.
Can you tell me about that conversation?
She made up her mind to go to college.
Tom rushed out of his office.
They never returned to their country.
Do you spend most of your time worrying about things that don't matter so much?
Please be careful.
I'm a baker.
Mother gets up earlier than anybody else in my family.
Lots of famous people come here.
Tom wants Mary to be happy.
Please stick out your tongue.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I appreciate what you did earlier.
I want you to go somewhere.
She kept on working.
It would be nice to get married.
An individual is the smallest unit of the society.
She's very afraid of snakes.
I usually toss my loose change into my desk drawer.
I feel better now.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.
You've got to go even if you don't want to.
How's the weather?
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
I may have left my wallet on the bus.
It brings me great joy.
I saw one.
Excuse me, could I get past?
Snakes are reptiles.
I put my clothes in the dryer.
I want you to tell the truth.
We're out of stock.
Scream as loud as you can.
No wild tigers are to be found in Africa.
Our house is yours.
There was a steady increase in population.
It's a questionable policy.
I must say I'm a bit disappointed.
I feel terrible.
What are your measurements?
She surprised him when she arrived early.
Do you miss it?
Were you happy?
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
I will write you back soon.
He has a foreign car.
A little work won't kill you.
Here is your bag.
I've always hated biology.
Do you want wine?
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
Time's up.
Tom's book was translated into French.
Tom scratched his head.
This may be research my secretary did.
I realized that even though I wanted to eat, I didn't have enough time.
My plan is working perfectly.
You don't seem very satisfied.
I won't do that again.
You will soon be convinced I am right.
Why did you want to speak with us?
Here is a present for you in token of our appreciation.
Did anybody see you?
That's not your problem anymore.
You need a joystick.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
Is the customer always right?
I'm going to the country with my friends.
Would you trust them?
I just want to cry.
It's hard being a parent.
I borrowed money not only from Tom, but from his wife, too.
What does she have?
Enjoy the show.
What's Tom's office number?
He is proficient in English.
Tom grabbed the rope with his right hand.
I don't need to talk about it.
Money doesn't necessarily make you happier.
Tom and Mary value their privacy.
My figures don't seem to tally with yours.
Tom clearly lied.
I worked hard for this money.
We will have to put off the soccer game because of the bad weather.
My wife and I are expecting our first child.
Why would you want to share this type of information with people you hardly know?
Tom doesn't want to live in Boston.
Was that all you wanted to say to me?
I'm not in a position to give you advice.
I saw a movie for the first time in two years.
Was anybody else hurt?
Pay what you want.
I know it's going to be unpleasant to talk about the accident.
I've never seen such a beautiful sunset.
The switch is on.
He visited a friend.
I'm not married to Tom anymore.
Cats were sacred animals in ancient Egypt.
Why can't you do it?
How do you always do it?
I just wanted to have a little fun.
Come run with me.
I'm going to go wash my hands.
Why is love so difficult?
Get real!
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I can't help myself.
We're not allowed to do that.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
It's not broken.
That looks like fun.
The laws were very difficult to enforce.
I tried to cheer him up.
Honesty isn't always the best policy.
Close that door.
He looks like a bug.
I outrank you.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
That's one of ours.
I didn't read it all.
How big is the sun?
She was a charming woman.
I'm going to America this summer.
One of her three cars is blue and the others are white.
Check that.
Do you think Tom is sick?
I think I'd better call Tom.
Be as specific as possible.
I really need it.
Life is too short.
She was in agony.
Tom got up from the table and walked into the kitchen.
There is very little probability of an agreement being reached.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
Tom doesn't want to read that book.
Everyone is special.
I'm not an early riser.
What does it look like?
You don't sound very confident.
He doesn't allow interruptions.
Is this going to cause us any problems?
Stop talking about Tom.
Could you please overlook it this time?
She is always complaining about something or other.
Politicians never tell us their inner thoughts.
I want to see your boss.
Why not just stay?
This room is for rent.
What time did you arrive there?
That's so tragic.
You're powerless.
This is love.
They are my classmates.
If it had not been for your advice, I would have failed.
We all know it.
My parents forbade me to see Tom again.
I don't feel any pain.
She always takes her time in choosing her dress.
The food supplies will not hold out till then.
Life is full of mysteries.
A piano is expensive.
Am I on the right track?
I'm in pain every minute of every day.
She used to live in luxury.
Do me a favor.
I went not once, but twice.
Can you narrow that down a little?
He is no more a fool than you are.
You had better make use of the opportunity.
I was fired in 2013.
We played tennis yesterday.
I will explain it to him.
She tasted the cake to see if it was sweet enough.
You should really lay off that. It'll ruin your health.
I'm not married to Tom anymore.
You'd better not go today.
She's no spring chicken.
It's no use kidding myself.
I won't be getting married this year. In fact, I may never get married.
He gave body and soul to his job.
When can you start?
That's what I'd like to know.
Can you give me another example?
I require your assistance.
I got my hair cut.
Nobody forced you to help me.
The book you're looking for is on my desk.
I can't invite all my friends at once.
You must control yourself.
I didn't have a choice.
What did you eat for lunch today?
I was thinking of getting one.
You're very nice.
They took a big risk.
I am looking for a job near my house.
Is your name on the list?
She didn't want him to die.
I visit my grandmother twice a week.
We're hoping to open in October.
She intended to go shopping.
He likes swimming in the summer.
I'm a patient.
There's a lot on the line.
I didn't want to tell you that on the phone.
I feel better today, but I am not well enough to work.
Tom can play the flute.
I have a fish tank.
Tom and Mary both shook their heads no.
Can I use a credit card?
I want you to understand this isn't going to be easy.
How many teeth does a horse have?
You hurt him.
We look forward to getting back home.
Tom doesn't live with his wife anymore.
I wanted to retire three years ago.
My idea is different from yours.
He lives six houses beyond my house.
This kind of cat doesn't have a tail.
You sound angry.
Opinions vary from person to person.
She celebrated her fifteenth birthday yesterday.
I gave him a call.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
Tom doesn't have to go if he doesn't want to.
I have no time to help you with the work.
Can you read Arabic?
Do you know her?
What did you buy?
Have you lost weight?
I have no religion.
You look so beautiful.
I have an apology to make.
As time passed, the radioactivity diminished.
I must go alone.
She looks familiar.
"Thank you for your help." "It's my pleasure."
We'll make a sailor out of you yet.
The coup attempt was foiled at the last moment.
I'm glad he liked it.
I feel a little insecure.
I have some gifts for you.
Get ready for bed.
I didn't know where else to go.
It's what he painted.
You were afraid, weren't you?
I think I'll go to bed early.
I borrow books from the city library.
I don't love her anymore.
It's a wonderful opportunity.
Why did you come here?
She put on dark glasses to protect her eyes from the sun.
I like to make people happy.
They each received a present.
Tell Tom what's going to happen to him if he does that.
What do you need me to do?
Don't call the police.
I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
Are all passengers on board?
I am not a prophet.
The house has been bought.
The problem remains unsolved.
Why are you alone?
Do you believe in miracles?
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Forget it!
No one wants to listen to my opinions.
Why do you want to die?
I think you're completely right.
It's not fair to you.
Is this why you've come back?
You're finicky.
Is that a problem?
My brother is good at mathematics.
I think you'd better leave.
She said nothing that would make him angry.
The weather is terrible.
I am used to living alone.
Do you think the shooting was accidental?
The boy is tall for his age.
Mother placed a large vase on the shelf.
I was busy this week.
Where were you coming from?
How many people are likely to show up?
Who's this hot babe?
I'll go get the proper forms.
Tom can't play a high G on his trumpet, but he can play an F.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
Welcome to San Francisco.
I refuse to answer the question.
I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.
You're the teacher.
I'll quit.
I suggest you listen carefully.
I hope you won't be disappointed.
That song reminds me of my home.
Are you all doing well?
Who says Tom knew?
The hat costs less than the coat.
That is a mistake.
I had a good coach.
You won't feel a thing.
He will go to New York next month.
There was nothing I could do to change it.
May I open a can?
Did you do all this?
I knew before you knew.
Do you love music?
You don't have to get up so early.
We started a band because we were bored.
Play it cool.
I was moved to tears by the story.
What are we supposed to do?
I want you to be my partner.
Could you show me that?
Is that one of ours?
I regret that I did not work harder.
You might want some of this.
You'll soon get used to eating Japanese food.
Several plans were proposed.
Nice timing.
I have a coat, but I don't have a hat.
Are you real sure about that?
He was advanced to the rank of general.
Give it to whoever wants it.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
Will you eat dinner?
Fry an egg for me.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
I hope to return soon.
I don't think I snore.
Tom brushes his teeth after every meal.
What foods are you allergic to?
She pulled him out of the mud.
I didn't sleep long enough.
Would you like me to repeat the question?
He witnessed the accident on his way to school.
You've got a great memory.
These people hate all foreigners.
I'll take a shortcut across the garden.
What do you have to complain about?
You'll ruin everything.
She ignored all my warnings.
I gave it my best shot.
We ate breakfast at seven.
We can't do this again.
I remember the horror I felt when she screamed.
I don't know who they are, but they don't look friendly.
I have to take a shower.
I hear that she is a famous actress.
Would you step aside?
He left an immense fortune to his children.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Will he ever change?
I'll spend the night here.
You are in over your head.
He was impressed.
We're not so sure.
This is what I was waiting for.
I don't like it when he does that.
Has Tom ever told you how he lost his leg?
Get out of here, all of you!
Do not cast pearls before swine.
You're boring.
They just taught me to swear.
I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.
I'm afraid we won't be able to help you tomorrow.
Tom asked me to give you a message.
I'm going to be your teacher.
I want you out of my life.
He hasn't returned yet.
I feel like you don't really care about me.
That's beautiful.
I eat in the house.
Can it be phrased in another way?
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
I'm humming.
You should give up smoking and drinking.
I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight.
I lit the oven.
Do you plan to go overseas?
She is wearing a blue dress.
She was advised by him on that matter.
What are you hinting at?
I don't like this weather.
I'm exhausted.
We'd better not change the schedule.
I haven't had time to look for what you wanted.
It's going to take me a while to get this done.
He comes from England.
She is about as tall as me.
I feel dizzy every time I get up.
This is impossible for me.
I have lived here for ten years.
I just can't wait.
She applied her handkerchief to his wound.
He's a comedian.
It was a stroke of genius.
This is the very book you wanted.
I was hoping we could still be friends.
Adjust the brakes.
What do you like to do in your free time?
He gave me a piece of advice.
Tom is supposed to meet me here.
Do not talk with your mouth full.
Call a plumber.
If they'd taken their doctors' advice, they might not have died.
What makes you think so?
I felt sorry for you.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
I was planning on it.
The mother separated the fighting children.
Let's start with beer.
I hate traveling.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Which one will they choose?
X marks the spot.
Do you want to join me for lunch?
Tom had to spend a night in jail.
She stared at him with hatred.
Don't touch the stove.
She shrieked.
Which sport do you like the most?
Who do you know in Boston?
When it comes to fishing, he's an expert.
The parking lot is free of charge.
Wherever you go, you'll be welcomed.
These books are ours.
She is very afraid of the dark.
I'm willing to try eating anything you eat.
We mustn't waste our energy resources.
It's the sort of day when you'd like to stay in bed.
You can't have the job.
Tom is taking care of me.
What's the meaning of that?
They were members of the middle class.
I'm reporting for duty.
Tom scares everybody.
She has many valuable books.
You didn't warn me.
Improved medical technology has been one of the spin-offs of the space program.
You must steer clear of that gang.
There is no public transportation around here.
I don't want to become like those people.
I think Tom was born in Boston.
Tom called Mary before breakfast.
In woodworking, we classify wood as hardwood, softwood or exotic wood.
I like these hats.
We're learning French.
Is the Orient too foreign for you?
I ordered fries, too.
Take good care of yourself.
Developing political awareness takes time.
Don't try to do two things at a time.
I don't find that comforting.
How did you handle the situation?
Do you know who that person is?
Don't just whine, do something!
Tom said he wanted to help us.
My shoes are too small. I need new ones.
Do you get up at six?
It wasn't as expensive as I expected.
May I ask a couple of questions?
Tom is at work, isn't he?
Of all the films I rented, this is the only one worth seeing.
He turned over in bed.
You really don't get it, do you?
You're totally right.
The prices remain as they were.
Who are these men?
Is this your first time in Japan?
I failed.
You're free of all responsibility.
He had a second helping of soup.
I think you look hot.
Do you think you'll be here tomorrow?
Which students will take the test?
I couldn't do anything.
All three of us are students.
Where is the beach?
Our supply of food is exhausted.
What time will you leave?
Come and see me once in a while.
Millions of workers lost their jobs.
His story was published in a magazine.
You don't have to answer.
He left a minute ago.
I told you guys to go home. Why are you still here?
How long have you been learning French?
I'll be working.
I love visiting Boston.
Are you about done?
I have a favor to ask of you.
No matter how hard I try, I can't swim to that rock.
We have no hot water because the pipes broke.
Tom scared the children.
There aren't any fish living in this river anymore.
We'll do it together.
Call Tom.
He wrote about plants and trees.
I am very pleased with my new house.
Can you believe this is really happening?
I never thought they would accept me.
My hobby is shopping.
She did it easily.
I will definitely attend your funeral.
The law is full of ambiguities.
I couldn't let you do that.
Let me hear from you very soon.
Let's replace all of them.
The students demonstrated against the new government.
Someone is tapping at the door.
Tom was disappointed in Mary's performance.
Tom should leave.
The answers are all right.
That is actually what I wanted.
Tom was silent for a moment.
You can't eat here.
You're a funny guy.
I don't want it.
Make a sentence with each of these words.
Did you sleep all day?
I can do it in half the time.
Tom is a biochemist.
I'm glad you're still here.
He has no fear.
The pond is 100 meters in diameter.
Whose notebook is that?
He sent me an affectionate letter.
I'd like you to have this.
Can I see you again?
I go to the office by bicycle except on rainy days.
I'm not taking any chances.
Tell me about it.
Why are conventional language classes so boring?
I am yawning because I feel sleepy.
Get your gear.
They can raise your rent.
It's all true.
In my job I have to deal with all kinds of people.
I've already paid you.
Tom was arrested last year.
Who told you to bring me here?
Why is autumn called "fall" in America?
They usually go to school from Monday to Friday.
My mom walked into my room.
Buy me a drink.
I have a few tickets in row 15.
Is that you?
I am hungry because I did not eat breakfast.
What do you think now?
The part of an iceberg under the water is much larger than that above the water.
How do I get to the bus station?
If that guitar weren't so expensive, I could buy it.
I don't know anyone here.
Guess what I want to talk about.
Stand back, please.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen.
My son won't listen to me.
I'm not thinking about it.
I think maybe you've made a mistake.
Where were you that whole time?
As far as I know, such a function doesn't exist.
I will be glad to help you anytime.
Wow! That's cheap!
Yours is better.
We should probably go.
No one is at fault.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
Do you have any idea when those pictures might have been taken?
I'm still married.
There's been a complication.
Don't just stand there, say something.
My sister is my daughter's godmother.
There are no new messages in my inbox.
You don't have to yell at me.
I've upset you.
Tom means what he says.
How many books do you read per month?
We all have jobs to do.
Tom can't win.
I met her by chance.
I'm too tired to do study.
I play guitar with a band every Saturday night.
I was deeply impressed with his courage.
I need a job.
The joke's on you.
I would like to meet his father.
I think it's important to tell the truth.
Tom asked Mary to watch the children.
I don't know how to pronounce his name.
Do you still remember how to do it?
I like busy places.
May I ask you a personal question?
This medicine does not have side effects.
Let's go on a road trip.
Close that door.
He did nothing but lie in bed all day.
She advised him to go home early.
He is good for five thousand dollars.
You were there, too.
They're all mine.
Which of them is your brother?
Wait one moment.
I am worried about my mother's health.
You feel lonesome, don't you?
We're dancing.
I'm not jealous.
Are you leaving now?
She decided to study abroad.
I love to watch baseball and football.
You may go if you choose.
I don't think I'd like you as a friend.
No one could've predicted this.
He was standing there with a vacant look.
I want to buy you a drink.
It was terrifying.
Was it an explosion?
Tom said he was starving.
This is what I've always wanted to do.
Let go of my hair.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
It is none of your business.
He will not go.
Be careful!
She looked more beautiful than ever.
He is by far the best student.
Can you give us your point of view?
Why don't we do this later?
When I take a deep breath, a pain runs down the right side of my back.
It's all I know.
They're all watching TV.
I had a conversation with Tom.
She is well known both in Japan and in America.
I'll take what I can get.
I remember meeting him in Paris.
We've still got a long way to go.
He gave three wrong answers.
Tom seemed fairly happy.
I've always been a hard worker.
The company issued a press release.
What a team!
Let me help.
Nobody knows it's my birthday today.
I knew you were behind it.
The war in Europe ended.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
Tom still doesn't know what happened.
Why won't you look at me?
Who was absent from school last week?
We looked ridiculous.
What's she doing?
Is everybody hungry?
Tom lives in the apartment above us.
He is a teacher.
That's why I'm here.
She found the ring that she had lost during the journey.
Have you really already found a new job?
Remember your promise, Tom.
This is love.
We've already wasted enough time.
I'm fighting mad because someone stole my bike.
That must've hurt.
Tom barely speaks French.
I was warned.
I need someone to hold me.
It's a piece of cake.
This doesn't serve any purpose.
The baby is fast asleep.
Prices are rising.
I understand the rule.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
Tom likes making paper airplanes.
I can't help thinking my father is still alive.
That was absolutely unnecessary.
Can we go?
We saw what looked like an oasis in the desert.
Don't treat me as if I were a child.
I want to meet the teacher.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I just didn't know how.
Negotiations are proceeding very slowly.
Both Tom and Mary are thirsty.
I was very careful.
I like learning ancient languages.
Tom's arm brushed against mine.
We have to do that as soon as we can.
I take pride in what I do.
You have a lot of books.
I want to see your house.
You will have to apologize when you see him.
What results do you anticipate?
They adapted themselves to the change quickly.
He is working on a new novel.
Are you ready?
He was drafted into the army.
Stop reading.
I hate to see a grown man cry.
I'm out of ammo.
I was happy to see her again.
It was just a coincidence.
I was canned.
He may not be able to come.
He's never been abroad in his life.
Every nation has its own myths.
I felt awful.
We should let sleeping dogs lie.
The museum is open from 9 a.m.
Oh, don't be so modest.
No matter what you say, I won't give up.
Tom can do it, can't he?
Just think about how you'd feel in a similar situation.
I ought to have made a hotel reservation earlier.
There is no life without water.
I was the one who built this doghouse.
May I ask you something?
I don't believe he is a lawyer.
My grandpa is out of step with the younger generation.
They all deserve to die.
You don't look like a millionaire.
You can wait for me here.
Hollywood isn't what it used to be.
I held on to the rope tightly so I wouldn't fall.
I prefer it that way.
My father has bought a new car.
She had to choose her words carefully.
He has completely avoided being sentimental.
He has nothing against it.
They're out to get you.
His high salary enabled him to live in comfort.
I can pick out only two or three constellations in the night sky.
I felt the floor shake.
Tom never said no.
My sister is too young to go to school.
Message me online.
We all escaped without injury.
I decided to tell her that I love him.
Have you ever seen a spider spinning its web?
I can't run as fast as he can.
I recognised him immediately.
Tom is drunk.
I should've known it was you.
The patient's in the hospital.
I've ruined everything.
Tom has two weeks of paid vacation.
He countered their proposal with a surprising suggestion.
I can't walk because of my broken leg.
Tom doesn't live here.
Could you pass the salt?
Try not to look so nervous.
Language changes as human beings do.
The reason is that I want to be an English teacher.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
What can you say?
Keep away from me.
You've been suspended.
He is my colleague.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Switzerland is a neutral country.
She must have told a lie.
Try to make the most of every opportunity.
You really are something.
He tried with all his might to lift the box.
We have a good team and everyone knows it.
I haven't eaten French food since I left France.
Tom escaped unscathed from the wreckage.
I tried to do all I could.
I appreciate your support.
I paid ten dollars for this cap.
Don't move unless I tell you.
I don't want to discuss it anymore.
I should have paid a little more attention.
Can you show me how to do this?
Is the university library open now?
You need to save the princess.
The room is empty.
Do you think the rainy season will set in early this year?
I'll get off here.
It goes without saying that smoking is bad for your health.
We lost sight of the man in the crowd.
He is apparently responsible for it.
He hurt his knee when he fell.
Tom is defenseless.
Go and open the door.
He gave an address to the nation on TV.
Let's wrap this up and go home.
Promise me that you'll do that.
Which hat do you want to buy?
Heat turns ice into water.
Have you taken your medicine yet?
Are you that stupid?
They live in constant fear.
Tom wants to make everyone happy.
Please do not kill me.
I have my share of doubts.
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
Did you need me?
Did Tom know what to do?
The fire was so intense that the firemen couldn't get into the house.
I feel great and I feel healthy.
She couldn't have said that.
He likes geography and history.
Tom sent a dozen roses to Mary on Valentine's Day.
Do you think I'm healthy?
He was talking nonsense.
I guess I felt like eating something different.
I am so sick.
Tom jumped off the diving board.
Tom asked me if I had a black tie he could borrow.
Are you resourceful?
If you don't want to stay alone, I can keep you company.
I want to live in a quiet city where the air is clean.
How about playing golf this afternoon?
Tom is good at public speaking.
Tom looks very happy.
And then, what did you do?
When do you want to eat?
I will go if you go.
It snowed in Osaka.
I'm reasonable.
Tell me again when the concert begins.
I've decided to leave on Monday.
We haven't been there in a while.
Tom asked Mary to play tennis with him.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
She began to sweat.
I'm certainly not your friend.
The noise was so loud that it was a nuisance to the neighbors.
He will come.
Tom lived in that small house for a little over ten years.
I'll never leave.
Tom calls Mary every night.
She was stupid enough to go out with him.
Get a job.
I have to go.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
We organized a farewell party for her.
Eating yogurt with a fork is somewhat difficult.
I want to set the record straight.
Every student has access to the library.
Please have some copies made.
Don't worry.
You must have been surprised to find me alone with her last night.
Tom doesn't seem to know Mary.
My father was a teacher.
Who am I to second guess him?
Tom and Mary have almost nothing in common.
If there is anything you want, don't hesitate to ask me.
He's not the brightest guy in the world.
I'm so glad we did this.
I want to end this.
I have the house all to myself.
I thought you read my resume.
It's self-explanatory.
I had to work hard to keep up with the other students.
Wait for your sister.
I think Tom told you the truth.
What's troubling you?
We were always together.
The door is open. I'll go and shut it.
I want to be very clear about that.
She lives in this neighborhood.
I can't be seen with you.
They're doing it right.
Tom went to business school.
I don't like to be alone.
I drank a glass of milk this morning.
Are we disturbing you?
Did Tom tell you the good news?
In the future, you have to get here on time.
She turned off the radio.
I was very tired.
Thanks for your invitation to the party.
Here's one of my favorites.
Who's coming?
I think you're going to want to sit down.
They are talking about what they will sing.
This will help keep you warm.
How are you going to do that?
I don't like such sports as tennis and golf.
Did you speak with him about your projects?
Is Tom a member?
Tom finished the job in three days.
Tom is taking care of that.
Sometimes I hear things.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
Tom is ashamed of his body.
We all hate Tom.
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
I majored in psychology.
What you did was wrong.
I told you I hated that shirt.
I can't possibly manage it.
Adolescents often quarrel with their parents.
Are you having any difficulty breathing?
I haven't started.
Find Tom.
I just fainted. That's all.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
Apples were served as the dessert.
They danced until six in the morning.
Do you believe in guardian angels?
He denied having said such a thing.
As soon as I can figure out how to send money, I'll send you some.
Where did you learn French?
I never thought you really did that.
I was misinformed.
I turned the lights out.
I got dumped.
I've been working.
I was playing tennis.
I am what I am today thanks to my parents.
I don't get what you mean.
Did you have fun last night?
I've got to get going.
Didn't I give you 10,000 yen a week ago?
Aren't you convinced?
Please tell me.
Tom heard everything we said.
I don't have time for a vacation this year.
You're being bossy, aren't you?
Many schools are closed today because of the storm.
That was easy.
It is dark in that room.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
Everybody knows his name.
Don't call me a jerk.
I am looking for an assistant.
A caravan of fifty camels slowly made its way through the desert.
My mother is well off.
I persuaded him to consult a doctor.
Just give me what I want.
Tom certainly got the message.
How is it that you know so much about Japanese history?
Take a cookie.
That time table gives the hours of arrival and departure.
You're forgiven.
If I could, I would let every caged bird fly free.
Your speech will be recorded in history.
I read all kinds of books.
Tom turned on the light in the dining room.
I visited Boston last month.
Now I understand.
We never got the chance.
Come and keep me company.
My pen isn't as good as yours.
She had a basket full of apples.
Just try it out.
That's a hard question to answer.
I feel safer here.
Tom is a good person.
Will six o'clock suit you?
Tom drives slowly.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
You're just a kid.
Hand in your papers.
You're not tired, are you?
I think you owe me an explanation.
The dog follows me wherever I go.
It looks as if you're right.
He belongs to the brass band.
Tom changed the subject.
I love to take pictures.
You're three years older than Tom.
You need to be careful when you're driving a car.
Fill in this application form and send it at once.
What have you come up with?
Am I supposed to believe any of that?
It was not always this way.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Tom isn't doing it the right way.
Which one's the new one?
It's time to go to school.
What was the weather report?
I don't like the way she speaks.
I am your friend, right?
I asked for a seat in the no-smoking section.
I hate doing things like this.
It made me laugh.
I don't want to go bald when I'm still young.
I want you to tell me how to do this.
I just got off duty.
We were shown all of their family photos.
It's shockingly inexpensive.
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.
When he got to the station, the train had already left.
I think you're ready.
He pressed the button and waited.
Please stay as long as you wish.
I hate you.
He delivers newspapers.
I have three sisters.
Tom looked embarrassed.
I can't help but feel like I've forgotten something.
The whale shark is the largest shark in the world.
Let's not forget that.
Here's a list of people I want to invite to our wedding.
Tom looks a little uncomfortable.
That's hardly believable.
I wanted to have a beer with you.
Tom has back problems.
The cat dug its claws into my hand.
There is nothing new under the sun.
Business is looking up.
Did I wake you up?
Quit gambling.
He may be able to come tomorrow.
I teach French at a nearby junior high school.
This does not bode well.
He loves attention.
It gets worse.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
He looks suspicious.
I have visited Paris once.
I still need to use these things, so please don't take them away.
He skipped a grade.
Live and learn.
Tom is a person you can trust.
I love the way you kiss.
I regret to say he's gone for good.
I like this store.
He was the first to help her.
You can't just walk in here.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
We all wondered why she had dumped such a nice man.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
I made tea.
I want to hear you scream.
You need to help me do this.
Where do you get off telling me that?
Tom wasn't expecting this.
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
Don't even get me started.
Do you know me?
Tom slipped and nearly fell.
Should I wait for you here?
How can you be so sure?
Tom has decided to sell his car.
I'm glad you're doing better.
You're very tall.
Any time will do so long as it is after six.
You lied to me.
He fashioned a walking stick from a fallen branch.
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
The delay was unavoidable.
Most Swiss citizens speak two or three languages.
I want everyone to bring their children.
Who do you know here?
I don't know what you want me to say.
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
This seems excessive.
I've met people like that.
He talks as if he were a teacher.
Her success as a singer made her famous.

Will you please hold this edge?
If you want my help, you'll have to ask for it.
Many factors must be considered.
What's become of your dog?
They huddled together.
I didn't speak for long.
He lived abroad for much of his life.
My father is out.
It's not on the menu.
You know what I'm talking about.
Tom followed his parents down the street.
You didn't let me finish.
How did they manage that?
She was so angry that she could not speak.
Did you question them?
No one I know goes there anymore.
This essay is my own.
I will badly miss you if you leave Japan.
I danced all night long.
I've never told anyone that.
Will you sell your house to him?
Tom is a flying instructor.

I want to show you something I've been working on.
"I can make it to my class on time," he thought.
He wants to marry my daughter.
Horses are animals.
I loved you.
I know someone was here.
I enjoy working.
It's no wonder Tom's sleeping poorly; he drinks up to twelve cups of coffee a day.
The FBI secretly bugged the mobster's hangout.
A strange thing happened last night.
What did Tom drink?
His wish is to go to America.
Can't you help us?
Tom was lonely.
You all right?
How many people were killed in the store?
You're not invincible.
Tom has a driver's license.
That would be unfortunate.
I didn't see you come in.
I can't believe everything Tom says.
Obviously, she's sick.

He kept his sense of humor until the day he died.
None of us are happy.
You'll find out soon enough.
It was just the beginning.
Is this fish still alive?
That's not the end of the story.
I don't expect help.
We went to the same high school.
No one knows where Tom is.
I'm not sure that's suitable.
He was welcomed everywhere.
I really am very thirsty.
This isn't legal.
Measure each angle of the triangle.
He kept on singing.
I love it.
He seems happy.
I really like that girl.
She made him cry.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Her daughter is sick.
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
I need answers.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
I want to know when my baggage is going to arrive.
Tom always works hard.
I can't remember anything about that night.
Are we allowed to take pictures here?
It can be improved.
I have three dogs.
Nothing is more disappointing than to lose in the finals.
I can lend you one if you want.
I saw a dog swim across the river.
I had no choice but to accept the offer.
Tom had to make a fire.
Get back in the van.
Is that notarized?
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

This wasn't cheap, was it?
I've just finished my work.
"Everything accomplished starts with the dream of it," is a saying we all know to be true.

There is no one there.
All of my brothers died in the war.
If you heat ice, it melts.
Don't you pay attention?
I saw you outside.
I don't do this for the money.
I waited a whole year for that.
The situation is very bad.
You've often said so yourself.
Everybody expected that the experiment would result in failure.
It's ridiculous.
Stop harassing me.
I went to donate blood today.
I envy your good health.
This flower is yellow, but all the others are blue.
Where did they go?
Let's have a chat.
Do you think that's a coincidence?
What do you hope to find here?
Can you tell me the time, please?
I'm doing my homework.
Don't let him escape!
They said it's OK.
Do you have a receipt?
I must go alone.
We asked everybody the same question.
This is my driver.
Bad weather is no obstacle.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
I think you're funny.

He fought until the end.
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.

He took up gardening after he retired.
I wish I had your job.
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.

What do you have to do?
Tell me about your children.
How are we going to do that?
You're such a flirt.
I moved to Boston last spring.
The whole country was covered with snow.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
You are a good boy.
This is not very stylish.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
She showed him several books that were on the shelf.
I'll wait for you.
How can you not see that?
Love conquers all.
You're not helping much.
I don't bite.
We were glad when we saw a light in the distance.
That's my best guess.
You must think I'm really strange.
I thought she was cute.
I feel feverish.
The meeting was almost over.
We want to make everybody happy.
He always sings in the shower.
I managed to repair my car by myself.
I want to watch you dance.

It's a nice day and I feel like taking a walk.
They helped one another to make the school festival a success.
I suppose I could wait a little longer.
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
Would you like me to explain it?
You were perfect.
They had a heated argument.
She went there yesterday.
Would you please stop pacing around like that and just sit down for a second?
Leave us alone.
Where exactly are we going?
I found that restaurant by accident.
As for me, I have nothing against the plan.
I did what was right.
Tom likes oranges.

Why did you buy it?
He lives frugally.
Don't get the wrong idea.
She made a mess of the work.
Milk is a popular beverage.
Tom went to Boston a week ago.
I'm worried about the future.
I want you out of my room.
You can rely on him.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I'm glad to be here.
I'd like to go somewhere else now.
You're the one who trained me.
The proof is trivial.
Tom is a good man.
There was no trace of him.
Ask her her name.
I think Tom drank out of my glass by mistake.
They worked like bees.
I am in favor of your proposal.
It's difficult to help people that don't want your help.
I was at the hospital a couple of days ago.
I'm bored to death.
The table in that room is very nice.
All you have to do is ask him to pay the debt.
He's used to speaking in public.
What can I do to help you?
I admit that I was careless.
I've already paid you.
A bird can glide through the air without moving its wings.
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones.
She lives in a large house.
Do you think I'm stupid?
Can I eat in my room?
Go warm up.
You should eat something a little more nutritious.
I thought you were against this proposal.
Christmas falls on Sunday this year.
A policeman is outside.
Tom understands French.
Tom is a speech therapist.
He didn't like being poor.
Tom would've been very proud of you.
Take the oranges out of the fridge.
It's nearly impossible.
She's not at home now.
He makes the most of his opportunities.
Can I use my medical insurance?
Are you falling for me?
I want to date other women.
What happened to your dog?
You're not ready yet, are you?
Several people are sleeping in the next room.
Everyone should exercise their right to vote.
She burst into tears.
The prisoners have been released.
I have won.
Japan is a leader in the world's high-tech industry.
We all want the same thing.
Have you tried this before?
If that doesn't work, try something else.
Tom is nervous, isn't he?
We may as well start at once.
I don't enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around.
You should be careful in your choice of friends.
Tom is an inspiration to us all.
This is way better.
I cut my finger while trying to open the package.
She mixed him up with someone else.
Has he given up cigarettes?
I really wish I could be there with you.
Do you think something like that will repeat itself?
Would it have been better if Tom hadn't been there?
How many kinds are there?
I want to try my best for as long as I am physically able to.
He has a heated swimming pool.
We're not ready for this.
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona.
We were actually pretty lucky.
It's never too late to make amends for harm done.
You can't hold that against me.
Are you lonely?
I am a man.
Compared to Tokyo, London is small.
I parked my car by the gate.
Give us a ride downtown.
Whatever you do, don't blink.
I didn't move a thing.
This must be changed.
I never told you to lie.
What a miracle!
That sounds exciting.
I can't accept this.
He had heard wonderful stories about cities of gold with silver trees.
Drink less and sleep more.
The offer is too good to be turned down.
I can't hear Tom.
I can get us in.
Tom called Mary at about 2:30.
I did something bad.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
Of course, he is right.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
Right now, we have blueberries, blackberries, cherries, strawberries, peaches and nectarines.
When did you start studying Latin?
This must be for you.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be able to finish the report by 2:30.
Accidents will happen when they are least expected.
He arrived at the station at seven.
I really couldn't have done this without you.
Where were you? We've been looking all over for you.
I want more information.
I got up early as usual.
Tom remained silent.
Where shall we eat tonight?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
Tom is clearly lost.
My dog is pregnant.
Your father was right.
I sure hope so.
Is there another way to get there?
It was a real challenge for us to go down the cliff on a rope.
Do I have to do this now?
The bigger they come, the harder they fall.
He achieved his goal.
I wish I had a friend like you.
It's about time I was going home.
I hear she is going to get married next month.
If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
Don't take this personally.
She showed her guests how to eat what she had prepared.
Tom never wears pink.
He didn't divulge the information, not even under pain of torture.
I promised not to tell.
I think it's time for me to step aside.
He has no remorse.
That's really cute.
Why are you drying your hair?
Do the police have any suspects?
I fully understand your concerns.
Tom didn't look very well.
If it had not been for your raincoat, I would have been drenched to the skin.
I'm not persuaded.
Did you see the sunset earlier? It was really beautiful.
It was a long letter.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
We're stuffed.
Tom won't be staying long.
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
I'm not sure I can trust him.
I didn't cheat.
This stone was so heavy that I could not lift it.
This changes nothing.
We have a party tonight.
Tom wanted to dance with Mary.
My sister is afraid of all doctors.
It's crowded again today.
He's not supposed to be here.
Many men died at sea.
Do you know where they come from?
I didn't mean to kill him.
Do you want to do it right now?
Anybody hurt?
It's kind of late.
Why were you absent yesterday?
A blind person's hearing is often very acute.
I only feed my dog dry dog food.
They tried to discourage him from going.
We should go to the party.
I can't believe that didn't work.
I refuse to answer.
I don't like kids.
Now that he has gone, we miss him very much.
What do you want to do about it?
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I don't even know why.
Don't ramble.
Could you describe to the jury what happened?
Tom fell asleep and missed the end of the movie.
I want to eat something.
I really don't get you.
You may kiss me if you like.
Are you traveling alone?
Tom is scared to death.
You've got a vivid imagination!
This is not true.
My son is going to leave for France next week.
I love you like a son.
Tom started shaking uncontrollably.
All you have to do is to join us.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
My father won't allow that.
I'd die without you.
I thought you were hungry.
The violence lasted for two weeks.
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.
Do you think he will like that?
They carried water in buckets.
We need to make sure that this is true.
They celebrated his success by opening a bottle of wine.
She lived in the suburbs of Tokyo when she was young.
He is very stingy with his money.
This house has six rooms.
Do you want to come out and play?
A dangerous criminal has escaped from the insane asylum.
I'm too busy.
The unrest lasted three days.
Oh no, not again!
She married a sailor.
It's far too small.
It's a sign of the times.
I must do something.
I didn't really feel like going out.
Add 5 to 3 and you have 8.
Everybody was silent.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I'm going to take that as a yes.
Would you mind if I came along?
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
If it were not for the sun, we could not live at all.
Tom told Mary that it was over.
The crops have withered.
It rained continuously for three days.
I'm studying French because I need it for my job.
I was really shocked.
Do you have enough money to buy one?
Do you want me to talk to Tom about what's going to happen?
Turn it up.
Even though the accident was six months ago, my neck still hurts.
A dead leaf fell to the ground.
This is my house.
My uncle gave me a pair of shoes.
He will leave for the station an hour before the train leaves.
Tom sliced the tomatoes.
It won't be long before we can start.
We need to concentrate on coming up with a new plan.
Is there anything else you want from me?
Is this made in Switzerland?
To improve your fluency, you should try speaking with native speakers as often as you can.
Are your hands clean?
Unfortunately, I don't have time today.
She was in America last month.
He stayed in New York for three weeks.
We must look after her children this evening.
Was Tom there?
A small company employs 50 people.
The only way to know if it fits is to try it on.
You're charming.
Is death the only way out?
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
I agree with your interpretation to a large extent.
I have never heard him complain.
Is that really all there is?
We've all seen that before.
Hey, be careful with that!
I just want to check on something.
I suppose you have some ideas on how to handle this matter.
We're sneaky.
I know we're a little early.
I'm too sleepy to drive.
The robber was nabbed this morning.
Have you been out at all?
What time will you leave?
We had a narrow escape.
Have a taste.
Is that supposed to be a question?
Tom didn't want to testify against Mary.
She wiped away her tears.
That meant no.
We forgot to lock the door.
What book did you buy?
I miss my mom.
Don't you think this suits me?
I don't even like you.
It is better to give than to receive.
I can't believe I kissed you.
Please answer my question.
I wasn't born rich.
Tom hardly ever speaks French to his mother.
I have a wooden comb.
This book has many pictures.
Should you always freeze fresh meat?
No doubt she will win in the end.
I'm sorry. I know I overreacted.
We all have our orders.
Can you speak more than three languages?
I can't sleep with all this noise.
I figured it out by myself.
Let it be.
She learned her part very quickly.
You were late, weren't you?
I just got an idea.
It is about ten minutes' walk to the station.
They were dancing to the music.
You don't have to be so formal.
Would you please show me that skirt?
We've talked about that.
Do you want to see more?
I'm trying to talk to you.
Tom said he'd play tennis with us.
The old man sat down.
It's characteristic of him to behave like that.
My brother doesn't swim.
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
There's a hotel across the street.
Does he want to look at it?
I saw something very bright fly across the night sky.
I need the car keys.
I was able to play piano very well.
I'm not invited to parties.
The bell is ringing.
Would you please wait for a minute?
I've had a slight sore throat since this morning. I wonder if I've caught a cold.
Tom can be extremely dangerous.
I prepared two translations of the text.
Can you gift-wrap this, please?
What I really want is something hot to eat.
Have you already settled the bill?
Tom missed the bus.
I told you that was just a joke.
It's never too late.
What time do you go home?
I won't see him anymore.
Does anyone else use your account?
His view is quite logical.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
I can't believe we're talking about this.
How old is he now?
Do you take me for a fool?
I don't know if I can do this.
Please don't think of it that way.
I wonder why we have ear lobes.
He is madly in love with that girl.
She cried bitterly.
He spoke highly of you.
Walk tall, son.
Something had to be done.
See you.
Prices are double what they were ten years ago.
I believe that story.
I only have three dollars on me.
We heard shots in the distance.
Can you pick it up?
In those days, few people went to college.
I don't know what you do.
I'll finish it in two or three minutes.
Tom wrote a short story.
She took care of his wound.
I loved that car.
Do you have health insurance?
She is learning the piano.
I can't believe he renounced his U.S. citizenship.
Be nice.
Say hello to your sister for me.
Who volunteered?
Don't stare at me like that.
I know how to settle this.
She ironed her shirt.
I can't let them catch me.
That's a sign.
I guess I should have read it more carefully.
He is telling a lie.
We considered it.
Tom isn't feeling at all well.
I ate potato chips.
He was delighted at the result.
My dog ate it.
You can use my dictionary.
The Japanese eat rice at least once a day.
I gave you a book.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
He needs to follow my advice.
A swarm of locusts descended on the cornfield.
He rarely went there.
She decided to resign her job.
I know you've been avoiding me.
How can I get to the station?
Nobody wants to do that.
I wonder whether Tom is really serious.
Kyoto is the former capital of Japan.
This tastes moldy.
I'm the one who picked those flowers.
He searched all day for the letter.
If it's all right with you, I'd like to stay for a while longer.
Tom paid Mary cash.
Look under the seat.
He hurt his knee when he fell.
Just give me some time. I'm sure I can figure out how to solve the problem.
I'm kind of sick today.
You may be right about that.
We didn't hear you come in.
He cut down a tree in his garden.
You can't hurt my feelings.
I plan to tell Tom about you.
Can you deliver it to my house?
I talked to everybody.
Where did you stay?
What happened exactly?
I've dreamed about it since I was a child.
I helped my mother clean the kitchen.
Were you spying on me?
I will act on your advice.
He is afraid of death.
I am folding my dress.
I don't deserve it.
I don't care what you do.
Tom will bat third.
I lost my favorite pen.
She gave me plenty to eat.
I know I've told you this before.
My new shirt is already dirty.
We have other priorities at the moment.
She wasn't able to meet him.
Where did I put my keys?
I don't think Tom realized just how much Mary loved him.
I've decided to end our friendship.
I hate my life.
It's way too heavy.
You're not fat.
I didn't even notice you.
I've decided to give Tom another chance.
He had an accident and broke his leg.
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
Can you see that small house?
She was superstitious, as the people of that period usually were.
He acknowledged me by lifting his hat.
How did you become involved in this project?
The moon is shining.
We kissed each other.
It seems interesting to me.
I couldn't do anything about it.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
There's nobody home.
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
Could you lend me your bicycle for a couple of days?
I want to be on the other team.
Were you born there?
Somebody is playing the piano.
Is that what you said?
Do you want me to walk you home?
Are seats available?
Don't come any closer.
This town is increasing in population.
Please treat the cat well.
That song reminds me of my childhood.
She was advised by him on that matter.
He directed all his energy to his business.
He took his book.
All of you look healthy.
Are you over your cold yet?
I want to bring my family here.
I'm not going to name names.
I will give you whatever you want.
I found a place to live.
I hate to see you so miserable.
Why are you leaving so soon?
It snowed a lot last year.
When did you notice that?
I met him at the end of the platform.
Take a picture.
Was that you on TV last night?
I thought we were going to go somewhere.
Which is the more expensive of the two?
Can you excuse me a second?
I ordered the book from England.
What I say is true.
We were up all night talking.
Tom hasn't played the guitar for years.
I don't know where my keys are.
I have billions of dollars.
I could use a little help over here.
Is that depressing?
The car is very fast.
I got off at the wrong station.
Does this mean that we have to file bankruptcy?
I've ordered you a beer.
Everyone gathered together for the picture.
This is on sale.
He can speak both English and French very well.
I don't like apples.
She was a Wakahata before she married.
Did anyone miss me?
If I tell my mother, she'll worry, so I don't think I'll tell her.
We'd like separate checks.
The handyman was supposed to arrive at twelve noon, but got stuck in a traffic jam for a few hours.
You should inform your mother as soon as you can.
What's the name of your insurance company?
Tom was a baseball player.
I do have a plan.
Fresh fruit and vegetables are good for your health.
The telephone doesn't work.
Are you children all right?
He had a new suit made.
What made you come here so early?
This is all for you.
Those flowers are beautiful.
I may try again later.
She bought him a car.
He was right to give up smoking.
You can rent a boat by the hour.
This one's on me.
Can I go to work?
We're happy with our car.
Mine is totally different.
The dog barks at all strangers.
I'm better.
Tell me when you will call me.
I ate a hot dog for lunch.
Now stop crying.
I'm not here to fight.
How do you know how thick it is?
My father does not eat much fruit.
Every mistake made me stronger.
I ran into a tree.
What have you come here for?
We're sloshed.
This tea is too bitter.
It was a joke.
Tom said that he was going to be late.
I promised Tom I'd not tell anyone.
I thought we should leave.
Were you drinking?
Environmental changes gave rise to new species.
I can't let you go in there alone.
Here he comes.
Don't act like you know me.
I was very patient.
We are listening to the radio.
We lay on the grass.
Let's get out of the rain.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
I don't know when the meeting started, but it started at least thirty minutes ago.
Tom has a blue car.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
You should follow Tom's example.
I made that one.
He saw a light far away.
I can't wait for school to start.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
A ball hit her right leg.
I miss my parents.
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends.
You're not safe here.
I feel like I know you.
Teenagers often argue with their parents.
He died suddenly.
Someone has stolen all my money.
Do you understand what's going on?
There you go again.
Let's review the evidence.
It was very funny.
I had a lot of help.
One of the children is studying, but the others are playing.
Are you coming to my party?
I wasn't feeling very well.
Termites are destroying the houses.
You're taller than me.
The idea is not new.
He is in trouble.
Did you lie to your parents?
He sings very well.
Tom is my boss.
He offered his seat to an old woman.
I love that movie.
She promised to marry him.
Do you have safety deposit boxes?
I don't know why it happened.
We will soon take off.
It was fun while it lasted.
This is one of the most influential novels of the past 30 years.
Will you come or not?
Thermometers often go below zero.
It's my dream to have a son who'll take over my business when I retire.
Click here for more information.
I feel guilty.
Tom taught me how to cook.
He always speaks well of her.
I'll tell Tom you were here.
I finally escaped.
Give me a beer.
The door was difficult to open.
Let her sleep.
Should I ask her out?
Hang on tight!
Tom quietly opened the door and tiptoed into the room.
Will it take long to recover?
I never received the money.
He secretly showed me her picture.
Put your pajamas on and go to bed.
I knew you could do it, Tom.
Tom did nothing illegal.
When was the last time that you did something for the first time?
He finally found out how to make it.
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
Are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
I just brewed a pot.
I'm an American citizen.
Has he stayed here before?
When it rains, she feels blue.
I didn't tell anyone what time I'd be arriving.
I need your answer by the end of the day.
Stop avoiding the question.
I could've met you at the airport.
I can't really put a price on that.
I can't stand it anymore.
There are some people who think it's a bad idea.
Tom seems unable to do that.
I'm sure that you'll succeed.
That's doubtful.
I'm sorry, I don't really remember.
She forgot to mail the letter.
We've got nothing to hide.
He leveled his gun at me.
Are you mentally ill?
He played an important role on the committee.
We're your friends.
He has no friends to talk with.
Will it be fine tomorrow?
Many young people go abroad during summer vacation.
We're not done.
Tom loves his children, of course.
He does not like us.
He wasn't there last week.
My throat's a little dry.
She wouldn't give him the time of day.
"What will you have to do?" asked her friend.
We are going to the market.
Show me that list.
What are you up to?
The TV doesn't work.
What a nightmare!
I have plenty of ideas.
Tom was the one who found me.
You should conform to the rules.
They know what's going on.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
We thought you were sick.
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
I never thought of it that way.
I saw a figure approaching in the distance.
I'll take care of this dog.
Do you want to do this?
My little finger is swollen.
Is he still interested?
You will regret this.
I took it for granted that you would join.
I played tennis with Tom.
He's in my class.
She wants a fourth generation iPad.
You need another ten dollars to buy that camera.
You're free of all responsibility.
I'll get the car.
I'm very sleepy now.
I'm suddenly tired.
Bring the water to a boil.
Think of what you are reading while you are reading it.
A boat suddenly appeared out of the mist.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
We have some guys on our team who can't speak French.
How long has it been since your divorce?
Are you on the committee?
Women eat lighter meals when they're eating with a guy.
As far as I know, he's guilty.
Is he a friend of yours?
Can I have a word with you alone?
She fell in love with him.
Something may have happened to him.
You're so sweet.
Let's hope Tom can do that.
The children were standing in line.
She likes oranges, doesn't she?
I will look after your cat while you are away.
Come here quickly.
They don't really care.
I do hope you will come and visit us soon.
Can you explain why Tom isn't here?
It goes without saying that nothing is more important than health.
The cops like the victim's boyfriend for the murder.
I don't feel sick.
He is fond of adventure.
What were you doing before this?
You've got a pretty good memory.
I wish I had studied harder for the test.
They're jittery.
He could read me like an open book.
Huskies get along well with children and other dogs.
Are you a good golfer?
We climbed the steep slope.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Nobody knows his name.
They shared the money.
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
I'm no quitter.
Now fix that.
I think it's time for me to clean the chimney.
You've got to be kidding me!
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
Are you coming with us?
I'll be back before you know it.
I'll study French next year.
I was on time for dinner.
You drive a hard bargain.
Are you on dope?
Go play outside. It's a beautiful day.
All you have to do is follow his advice.
I arrived at school on time.
I like having people around me.
I'll never tell anyone where I've hidden the treasure.
Providing energy to the poor without destroying the planet any further is this century's biggest challenge.
How old were you when you first did that?
Tom can't afford to retire.
Tell me why you didn't do what I asked.
I'm not going anywhere.
I thought you were older than me.
That's all I ask.
Why are you doing this?
I think Tom is sleeping.
I have a small favor to ask of you.
Thank you for the pleasant evening.
You can't tell anyone about this.
It was really incredible.
Come off it.
I've never been in trouble with the law.
Tom burst out laughing.
Which is it going to be?
Disconnect the power cable from the modem, wait for approximately one minute, then reconnect the cable.
Full religious freedom is assured to all people.
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends.
The sun is about to set.
It's dark.
My family is small.
When were these trees planted?
Is that a wolf?
Many Americans protested the purchase of Alaska.
Maybe Tom should pay more attention in class.
Can you write Braille?
I need a car.
What is it with you people?
His father approved of his plan.
You haven't seen Tom this morning, have you?
Where did you hear that?
I go to any party I am invited to.
When are you getting out of here?
I'm really proud of you.
Can you briefly sum up what was said at the meeting?
You are a bad person.
Tom can ski just as well as Mary.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
Tom likes Boston better than any other place he's lived.
That's going to cost you a lot of money.
I can't remember anything from last night.
You're not going to want to miss this.
I came early in order to get a good seat.
I don't understand what's happening.
Air, like food, is a basic human need.
Be more flexible.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Judging from his expression, he is in a bad mood.
I had hoped you might say that.
Have you ever ridden a mule?
She can speak French fluently.
You'd better make sure that it is true.
You shouldn't be drinking on an empty stomach.
How many did you want?
A good book is a great companion.
You can run, but you can't hide.
I need your help.
She looked at him and knew that he was angry.
Stand aside.
I asked who he was.
It may rain soon.
Take an umbrella. It's likely to rain.
I'm ambitious.
We all enjoyed the movie.
Which of the composers do you like best?
She was the first one to pay attention to him.
It's no use waiting for him to come.
If you testify against him, we can put him behind bars for good.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
The exchange rates are posted daily outside the cashier's office.
He is a good doctor.
What do you have in your hand?
Don't stand up.
I'm not old enough.
I'll get back to you.
I had a stroke last year.
I can't get back to sleep.
You didn't have to wake me up.
To tell the truth, I didn't go there.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
I should've gotten that promotion.
My wife harbors a deep-seated resentment toward her father.
We lost.
I'm thorough.
I don't feel very well. I should go home.
This paragraph is vague.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
I'm glad to see you.
She stayed in that area for a short while.
Why don't they just come and get us?
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
I didn't sleep well.
Tom says he won't vote.
You must not open the door.
I just don't want anyone to be mad at me.
What were you and Tom talking about?
I've lost my keys.
Everyone is proud of you.
It's a common mistake.
Tom will tell me everything eventually.
We're wasting water.
I didn't know where Tom wanted me to plant the marigolds.
Is that why they died?
I just wanted to make sure I was right.
The employees were intrigued by the odd behavior of their boss.
I may not get another chance.
You should go home early.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
You don't need to wait.
I believe what is written in her letter.
If only I'd hadn't stayed so long!
Did you try to listen to her?
That's really all I know.
A passing car hit a puddle and splashed water all over me.
I'm not your brother.
I don't think I can help you.
I want these people out of here.
Why did he live in the United States?
How do you deal with it?
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
That's not for you to decide.
He went shopping.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
I have a sister.
I wonder where she has gone.
What has brought you here?
I did my job.
You don't have to speak so loudly. I can hear you very clearly.
Tom still isn't quite convinced.
I just panicked.
How did you get hurt?
This elevator's capacity is ten people.
I'm hardly ever home.
You'll feel better.
They were afraid of the big dog.
No students went there yesterday.
They hurried by without a glance.
Thanks for your hospitality.
I'll think of a way to do it.
I want him to sing a song.
I cooked dinner.
I'll find my own way back.
She found the key to my heart.
It's very likely that he'll be chosen.
Does Tom like swimming?
I've got an appointment tomorrow with Tom.
Neither one of them disagrees.
Life isn't fair, is it?
She is a famous singer.
Don't try this at home.
I was hired.
In the U.S., it is common for people to write a check instead of paying cash.
Please correct it.
He visited Kyoto last year.
Be nicer to your sister.
Are you a model?
Don't you have an interesting face?
Tom always speaks French.
I have neither time nor money.
Would you please keep the noise down?
If it rains, the excursion will be called off.
I don't need your money. I just need your time.
I wonder why.
She came into the room.
I've got a little problem.
The leaves fell.
I'm sorry that I can't meet you tonight.
I think you should get started.
He didn't want to antagonize her.
I know you think there's no hope.
He didn't protest.
My dad gives me an allowance of $10 a week.
He really ticked me off.
You need not have called me.
They just left.
I appreciate the support.
You run very fast.
His brave deed earned him respect.
Facebook is blocked in China.
Why don't I call you?
Do you want me to explain it again?
Are you listening to me?
People believed her to be dead.
He gave me a stern look.
I woke up.
I'm sorry, I just wanted to help.
I was in London last month.
Can I use your phone?
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
Not all criminals need to be incarcerated.
Don't you think I know what people say about me?
Don't do it again.
Do you not like girls?
I don't know how, but you did it.
That wouldn't be a good thing.
Could you solve the problem?
I've never seen you laugh.
Do you want to say goodbye?
I think you'd better come back home.
It's an interesting argument.
When will you leave?
Do you work here?
That's his.
Have you ever visited Kyoto?
The book was published in 1689.
I will come if I have time.
He showed it to me.
I'm really feeling kind of strange.
I think Tom needs your help.
I apologize to all of you.
I don't doubt your intentions.
He accepted our offer.
I've got one brother and two sisters.
A river flows through the valley.
I have some English books.
It won't take long to finish the job.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
We don't have any proof.
That's cheap, isn't it?
I hope you enjoyed the show.
Choose any of these pens.
I appreciate the help.
I know quite a few people who don't eat meat.
You've turned up at the right moment.
Tom was chosen from among 300 applicants.
That's too long.
You are so stupid.
He can do five somersaults without breaking a sweat.
I wonder why I feel so lonely when it gets cold.
Don't be crazy.
She made it clear that she couldn't make it in time for the meeting.
They were left speechless.
It was just a passing infatuation.
Tom wants to live.
I have absolute confidence in your judgement.
I'm on a budget, so I don't eat out more than three times a week.
I was asked to umpire the game.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
I don't know how to explain it.
We're not responsible.
A lot of people swim here in the summer.
Did you tell everybody all about me?
You may as well go yourself.
He was hurt in the accident.
The bill must be paid today.
I found it necessary to get up early every morning.
It appeared to me that he was very intelligent.
Stop treating me like a child.
Look forward, please.
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Africa is the poorest continent.
I've upset you.
They settled in the country.
You look good in black.
He asked a favor of me.
I won't back down.
I've got to get going.
Thunderstorms are both scary and exciting.
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
What're you all dressed up for?
There's nothing else in the box.
Not a cloud was to be seen.
It will probably rain.
Why were you holding his hand?
It's going to be harder this time.
I hate fluorescent lights.
A few minutes' walk brought him to the zoo.
We're both wrong.
He's studying.
I'll do it in the morning.
We discussed the problem all afternoon.
I'd like you to read this book.
He got out from under the car.
I wasn't sleeping.
Hold on tight, otherwise you will fall off.
I'm worried about them.
I'd rather do this alone.
She allowed him to go alone.
Could you give me some advice?
Why not just quit?
I'm ready to go.
She made the same mistake as before.
This one's a little harder.
Those are very famous people.
This will be a game changer.
You don't realize how lucky you are.
Two coffees, please.
I left something in the room.
That's just what you needed.
A bat flying in the sky looks like a butterfly.
Tom sent money to his daughter to Boston.
You can do it, too.
What are you doing today?
Tom will eventually give in, I think.
Do you want to go for a walk later?
I'll give it back.
I do hear something.
I lived overseas for ten years.
What did you do with that car?
My brother loves taking pictures of mountains.
What time is dinner?
I should tell you something.
I was lonely.
Do you like white chocolate?
It cost $300 to get the car fixed.
You don't sound very confident.
It looks like winter is here to stay.
I'm ashamed to ask you such a silly question.
You're aren't one of us.
You shouldn't ride a bicycle on the sidewalk.
Where do the airport buses leave from?
The two towns are separated by a river.
She's promised to give me a ring.
You can tell what a person is like by looking at his friends.
I will do anything but that.
They were all scared.
Have yourself a drink.
We're undressing.
Why didn't she come?
You'll be crying before long.
This company uses cheap labor to increase its profit margins.
I want to be an actor.
They danced until six in the morning.
How did you spend your holiday?
You may open the window.
Who do you work for?
Who can blame you?
He ran away so he wouldn't be caught.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
I just want to watch a little television.
I had a feeling you would be late.
I'll take one.
Why are you at home?
I want to talk with you.
What were her final words?
I just want you to be happy.
The new road will benefit the people living in the hills.
Where did you buy this book?
They all objected to his proposal.
Don't try this at home.
Have you ever been arrested?
I have no time to write to her.
He left a minute ago.
I've lost it.
My aunt lived a happy life.
I always pay the rent on time.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
Are you drinking green tea?
Let's forget about what happened yesterday.
Don't you think I would like to do that?
I understand your problem.
Don't let your feelings show.
Is she at home?
The exact same thing happened to me.
I'm really not very good at French.
Japan has enjoyed prosperity since the war.
Take a look at these.
I'm talking on the phone.
I buy loads of stuff at that store.
Are you getting paid for this?
He did it out of curiosity.
He gave a series of lectures on Japanese literature at UCLA.
You're very funny.
The food is delicious.
Anyone else want to give it a try?
I want you to get some rest.
No man can serve two masters.
You're not upset, are you?
I asked him if I could read his book.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had.
What did you do on the weekend?
He came back at nine o'clock.
Tom knows why nobody came to his party.
She gained weight.
Please stay where you are.
You're the one I've been wanting to meet.
He hanged himself.
These senseless killings will not go unpunished.
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
Excuse me, could you repeat that?
Tom doesn't like any kind of music.
Where did you get that?
She was beautiful in her time.
That a boy!
We talk all the time.
Tom's budget contained a lot of guesstimates.
Do you still believe I killed my brother?
There is an urgent need for volunteers.
What year were you born?
There's no need for that kind of behavior.
Hurry up, and you will be able to catch the train.
I read this book when I was in college.
Please don't go home.
He is sure to succeed.
I need more.
Can I get you a drink?
Don't worry about your dog. I'll take care of him.
Tom was lying in bed watching TV.
I like to study foreign languages.
Don't worry. We'll find it.
Smell this flower.
The ground was very rocky.
You could do a lot if you put your mind to it.
The red hat goes well with her dress.
You must be out of your mind.
We've just spent two weeks apart.
You deserve a prize.
I believe you are honest.
You have to learn how to compromise.
I don't really want to learn French.
I saw one.
She called out to us for help.
We have two daughters.
There's going to be a downpour.
I want a dozen cream puffs.
You're over-analyzing.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Who is sitting at the other end of the table?
Tom is kind and generous.
Her dream will one day come true.
My big brother finished his homework very quickly.
He will come down soon.
I looked for him in the supermarket.
Prices continued to rise.
It is impossible for me to do so.
It's been a very difficult year.
He never told anyone.
He doesn't have any proof.
You'll get over it.
My father is in the garden.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I drink three or four cups of coffee a day.
Do you feel like going for a swim in the creek later?
I think you'd better take an umbrella in case it rains.
I've lived here for three years.
The loss amounted to $2,000,000.
It goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health.
How long did you stay?
I'm afraid of bats.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I'm the only one who survived.
That's not really important right now.
I chickened out.
His lackadaisical attitude to studying explains his poor grades.
You're too loud.
Where did I put my coat?
It is never too late to learn.
They are my friends.
Explain it to me.
Tom's famous.
Tom put the vase on the table.
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
The weather stayed bad.
A temporary government was established.
My back still hurts.
This is insane.
It costs an arm and a leg.
It appears that he will win first prize.
I won't accept that.
That is how the accident occurred.
She wants to marry a millionaire.
I need an assistant who speaks French.
They are doctors.
I cannot see this picture without remembering my childhood.
I'm on my way.
I appreciate your confidence.
Don't forget to pay the phone bill.
I want to know how you feel about this.
Well, that's upsetting.
They're enjoying themselves.
I don't need you or anybody else.
This desk is better than that one.
I hope you have insurance.
All the floors in her house are made of wood.
It's a double-edged sword.
Tom kept digging.
You're psyched.
I presented my ticket at the door.
I like to clean my room.
That is mine.
How did you know it was me?
What is it you want to talk about?
He chose to live in Tokyo instead of Osaka.
Do your homework by yourself.
Are there any Chinese restaurants near here?
Have you seen this man?
It's because of you that I'm an invalid.
Is it a joke?
Please say hello to your parents for me.
There's nobody in the kitchen.
He expressed his feelings in the form of a painting.
Try not to worry.
My house seems small beside his.
We were unable to make contact with them until it was too late.
We avoid talking about politics.
I'm still trying.
He washes the car every week.
I'm fed up with homework.
It seems that you are not having a good time here.
Some apples rotted on the tree.
I am sure we have a lot in common.
Try to find it.
We do all kinds of repairs.
It's said that she's a well-known actress.
Tom almost fainted.
I don't want to hurt you.
Are you bored?
The nightmare is finally over.
Can we cut to the chase here?
I'll accept your offer.
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
Are you up?
Tom probably thought I didn't like him.
Have a good time.
We'll be late for dinner.
Do you have a passport?
I dream about you quite often.
You seem a little nervous.
I like stories.
Do you like Boston?
What answer did you come up with for question three?
He is sitting on the chair.
Tom looks interested.
Tom and Mary have been trying to come up with a solution to the problem.
It cost me one thousand yen to get the bicycle fixed.
I think you should stick to your training schedule.
You can't have the job.
Tom has been up all night.
As is often the case with young men, he does not pay much attention to his health.
My heart aches for those starving children.
We're going to miss doing this.
I was hoping you'd know.
I'm still married.
That's why I called you.
Everybody will be tired.
Tom called to say he'd be late.
Your wristwatch is on the table.
What's the problem?
On second thought, I think I will have a slice of that pie.
The meeting was almost over.
Tom has three sons.
Ostriches can't fly.
I think his opinion is very important.
Sooner or later, the hostages will be released.
There are many people in the park.
Come home as soon as you can.
Come on! I can't wait any more.
What kind of person would spend so much money on a bicycle?
The problem disappeared as if by magic.
Let's stop at the next gas station.
I must repay the debt.
I don't find it intimidating.
I respect you.
I like to be thorough.
I received your note.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
I bought this book at Maruzen Bookstore.
They clung together for warmth.
I want some beautiful flowers to put on the table.
Can he see me?
When were you born?
I think you're being a little too careful.
Do I look happy to you?
May I speak to you a minute?
That's the last thing I would do.
I like your place.
You don't look like a millionaire.
Could you make a reservation for me?
That's just what I need right now.
That works.
He warned me of the danger.
Tom pointed at Mary.
Will you pay cash?
I want you to have a copy of this.
Get out of my seat.
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain.
We have to go.
I think your dreams are achievable.
My mother prepared me for the bad news.
I'm not overly concerned.
I'm broke and tired.
There used to be some big trees around the pond.
Go get it.
Which film did you see?
I don't think that's enough.
Never choose a vocation just because it promises social standing.
I work alone.
Just tell me what happened.
I've already filed my report.
I have a few friends here.
It makes little difference.
I don't know what to do here.
You should listen to me.
They got the short end of the stick.
I almost didn't sing that song tonight.
I didn't know where else to go.
I was embarrassed when he talked to me.
You did say that.
You're very emotional.
I don't want to upset you.
The engine would not start.
Tom's house is very big.
I'm about ready.
I didn't know that would happen.
He made a bad decision.
He looks confused.
He drank the whisky as if it were water.
I need it immediately.
Your mother loves me.
Are you from around here?
I can't believe no one heard that.
I think Tom is sad.
By the way, what is your address?
He's been drinking beer.
I knew it would happen.
You're such a tattletale.
I don't want to get a suntan.
Watch out for that man.
They are very cheerful.
I want my key back.
We have to attend that meeting whether we like it or not.
Show me your passport, please.
Quit acting like a child.
We're having a blast.
Were you obedient?
Can you tell me what Tom said?
I'm skinny.
I swear to God this is true.
I'm not here for you.
The installation is now complete.
Everybody loves her.
The rainy season begins towards the end of June.
I need to go to work.
Bring it here.
This is refreshing.
They're enjoying themselves.
There's plenty of light.
I feel like I could cry.
I thought this pair of shoes would last longer.
Tom promised not to smoke anymore.
My sister and I went to the castle.
Children need to play.
Tell me more.
Tom ran at full speed.
I know that this is important for us all.
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
There isn't enough cake for everybody.
I've had a very busy morning.
When was this car washed?
All at once there was an explosion.
Let me tell you something about Boston.
Take the garbage out.
I'll call you a cab.
I have been honest with him.
How old were you when you got married?
Tom tried to drink his problems away.
I thought you didn't want to go.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
What symptoms do you have?
Trust me on that.
Those dogs are big.
They're Asian.
I'm too tired to argue.
If it is fine tomorrow, we'll go on a picnic.
Write in the date yourself.
I want them to be your friends.
How many teams are there?
I thought I knew all your secrets.
I want to rent a car.
Which newspaper would you prefer?
Do you play tennis well?
She pushed him off the pier.
The Japanese government can't cope with the problem.
I want to do this on my own.
I'm glad to hear that your sister is out of danger after her operation.
Many of the people that need these drugs can't afford them.
You're making a big mistake.
We can't help you anymore.
Please be quiet.
We had fun, didn't we?
I have no friends.
It was just a dream.
You don't have to explain.
I don't really have a gun.
He laughed nervously.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
We've been out of touch with each other for a long time.
It is still light outside.
What a bore!
It's better than doing nothing.
Tom likes writing.
We learn a lot from experience.
Tom believed that John was his brother.
I've been hoping to meet you.
You can get a lot of bang for your buck at this store.
I used to tell people I knew how to speak French.
Do you really want to know?
You're either with me or you're against me.
He exchanged seats with the next person.
I have standards.
Don't be fresh to me.
Did you watch TV last night?
He jumped into the water.
He smells bad.
You're doing the right thing.
She's good at handling children.
It's quite clear to me that this is the truth.
Peel two of the bananas.
Don't touch it.
He attained his goal.
The royal palace was built on a hill.
I'm very happy to be back home.
You can't just not do your job.
The match was cancelled due to the heavy rain.
I want to share my thoughts with you.
I'd like to know how you got my phone number.
How was your flight?
They chased others away.
Will you go with us?
That doesn't sound so good to me.
I hate seeing you like this.
I never knew my father.
We learned that he had an accident.
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
There was no response.
He is always looking to the future.
I beg you to give me a little water.
I hope you brought coffee.
Quit acting like a baby.
I tried not to stare.
Here or to go?
Something isn't right.
We're almost there.
I remember the year when he got a job.
You're very smart.
You gave me hope.
Just give me the gun.
He won't leave us alone.
Everything appears to be going well.
I don't mind in the slightest who he is.
What's so funny?
After much consideration, we accepted his offer.
He looked as if he knew all about it.
Did I miss the turn?
What have I done with my keys?
What is his name?
You can't handle this alone.
I believe I can trust you.
Have you confirmed it?
He died at the age of 70.
My parents made me go there.
I appreciate your restraint.
What are you reading?
There's so much I want to show you.
It's not that I am unsympathetic, but I am not able to help you.
I can't say.
I love soul food.
Get them out of my sight.
He's writing his diary.
Have you eaten yet?
I'm retired.
The two girls wore the same dress to the dance.
I want vengeance.
Do I look tired?
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
He gave me a big hug.
The fire started in Tom's room.
Where are we going tonight?
I'm going crazy.
I live in this house by myself.
I can't stand that noise.
This is messed up.
I found the bed very comfortable.
You speak so softly that I cannot quite hear what you say.
Where are the other girls?
I saved your life.
I'm feeling dizzy.
Just wait a second.
At last, it began to rain.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
I want to have a cup of coffee.
Are you still not convinced?
Get out of the van.
Please turn on the radio.
She advised him to work harder.
True happiness consists of desiring little.
I feel blessed.
Tom is a carpenter.
You don't know what you're doing.
Cicadas aren't harmful to humans.
I appeal to you to contribute to the new clinic.
I paid for the purchase in cash.
If there's anything you want to do, you should do it.
Tom wanted to tell the truth.
Finally, we arrived in England.
Cities and provinces along the Yangtze River in central China are grappling with the country's worst drought in more than 50 years.
Do you know where I live?
Fortunately, no one was hurt.
The plane was late because of bad weather.
Perhaps he could solve this problem.
Just wait a second.
His house is at the foot of Mt. Fuji.
This song makes me want to cry.
Everyone's asleep.
Listen carefully.
Don't touch my car.
She tied him up.
You're silly.
From the top of that tall building, you can easily see the city.
I'm a little bit hungry.
Tom is not interested.
Keep your nose clean.
It had snowed.
I've never seen anything like this before.
No one will care.
Most young people have a mobile phone.
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
The captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship.
The surgeon persuaded me to undergo an organ transplant operation.
I dream about you every night.
I'd better call you back.
I'll try to keep it short.
I'm concerned.
An autopsy will be done in the next few days.
I didn't know about the accident.
You should carry out your promises.
I've kept my weight down even though many of my friends have gained weight as they've grown older.
I thought I was happy.
Someone's coming.
I am loved by my parents.
I wish you had come with us.
Swimming is one thing I can do fairly well.
I can't believe Tom did that.
Where did the bee sting you?
I probably shouldn't have eaten that.
The plants suffered damage from the frost.
Why would she go out of her way to help a deadbeat like you?
You'll go far.
Thanks for the advice.
He is engaged to my sister.
We've said our goodbyes.
This desk takes up too much room.
They won't help you.
I wasn't scared at all.
I quickly ate lunch.
Has Tom eaten anything?
I know what it's like to be alone.
I can't get in.
It is getting dark outside.
Tom and Mary are no longer in Boston.
Tom and Mary left Boston at the end of October.
I was just taking a shower.
I love you more than ever.
Did you love Tom?
The coach gave his team a pep talk before the game started.
Do not do that.
I was alone in the classroom.
I'm very sorry I came home so late.
All at once, the Buddhist priest burst into laughter, spoiling the solemn atmosphere.
I paid to have this done.
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.
Are you settling in?
We are working hard to make up for lost time.
Did I wake you up?
I don't really want to stop.
I apologize to all of you.
Who was the girl you were talking to?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
They weren't invited.
I should've known.
Tom is the one who woke me up.
Yesterday, I read a really interesting story.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I live with my mother, brother and my grandparents.
The Japanese art of flower arrangement is called Ikebana.
I take a walk with my dog in the evening.
I don't believe it's possible.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
They just want to get to know you.
We had little water.
She was heard to cry for help.
I wanted to know what would happen.
Do you belong to any clubs?
Can we speak in the hall?
How many cars have you owned so far?
He barely speaks English.
It was just a hunch.
I wanted to impress you.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
If I had known it, I would have told you.
I want you all out of here.
I like to swim.
I felt sad.
Show me some respect.
Do you want some water?
This Sunday is Mother's Day in Spain.
He was too drunk to drive home.
She sang a Japanese song for us.
I tried to give her some money, but she wouldn't take any.
You may use my car.
The story was in all the papers.
Charge it to my account.
I haven't seen these pictures in years.
Drive on.
Let me get that for you.
You should get checked by a doctor.
She helped him tie his tie.
When are you going to get married?
Why didn't they say something?
He heard a noise.
I want you to be my partner.
I have not eaten breakfast yet.
Tom's behavior at the party was inexcusable.
Do you not like girls?
Tom had reasons to be angry.
That is no business of yours.
Do you like going to school?
I think perhaps you're right.
What's the date today?
We will have some visitors one of these days.
She has few friends.
I'm between jobs.
It saddens me to hear you say that.
I think it's a good idea.
Are there enough chairs to go around?
The crown prince is the one who is to succeed to the throne.
Why do people do this?
No one has anything.
That's a pretty good idea.
Don't read that kind of book.
I can't understand his feelings.
He was left all alone in the woods.
He is not much better, and there is a little hope of recovery.
These are my favorite pair of shoes.
I'm not sure when he'll turn up.
Why did you turn down his offer?
They were lucky.
He needn't have come himself.
There wasn't much traffic this morning.
I have a test tomorrow.
I have to confess to you that I snore.
She began to sing.
You and I have the same idea.
This is top secret.
I thought you'd be taller.
There are no stupid questions.
I'm going to miss you, too.
Our teacher looks very young.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
You're pretty good.
It was a big help for me.
I have just returned from Britain.
I write poems in my free time.
Close the door, please.
The telephone rang a few minutes later.
I was born on October 10, 1972.
I forgot to tell you when to come.
I never wrote to her, despite the urge to do so.
I decided not to eat.
Tom is always open to new ideas.
You're the oldest.
You don't smell good at all.
Tom doesn't know French.
You get what you pay for.
How do you remember that?
France is to the south of England.
Life is like a journey.
It was very hot.
I really appreciate the fact that you like me just the way I am.
This is a great apartment.
He is a famous composer.
Who would you like to speak with?
If you want this job, you must apply for it by tomorrow.
I couldn't get rid of my doubt about it.
You might be interested in this.
The President is to speak on television this evening.
Have you been told where the meeting will be?
I could feel nothing but the knife as it plunged into my back.
I have been in Japan for three years.
My mother told me I needed to eat less candy.
Don't you have an interesting face?
He studied to be a doctor.
Tom couldn't help but cry.
Our dog will bite strangers.
They all look the same.
I don't normally do that.
What would you do without me?
What are you going to do with that?
Could I park my car here?
Please wait a moment.
I don't know anything about their relationship.
She replied that she had never seen the man before.
We have run out of sugar.
Traffic accidents are increasing in number.
Is there enough gravy?
Tom and Mary decided to leave.
Tom needs to do that now.
Give me your flashlight.
That's my suitcase.
He doesn't play video games.
I want to learn how to snowboard.
We don't need to do this every day.
Is anybody home?
I've got a good reason not to like Tom.
The trouble is that we have no money.
I'm not intimidated.
Don't be so rough on yourself.
It hasn't been done before.
You're not being rational.
Why do people dye their hair?
He is well liked by his students.
I feel kind of nauseous.
The conclusion is crystal clear.
The game was called off on account of the rain.
Be careful not to slip.
He demanded that I should pay the money back at once.
Stay and have a cup of coffee with me.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
We just want to live in peace.
Just say no.
This is foolish.
I take care of my grandfather.
My father disapproved of my going to the concert.
She is accustomed to doing her homework before dinner.
I asked him where I should park my car.
She was approaching thirty when I first met her.
Give me a second chance.
Don't eat without me.
We can't guarantee that.
She accused me of making a mistake.
He took on extra workers.
You owe it to those who are dependent upon you to do this.
I like surprises.
We never work on Sunday.
Someone's ringing the doorbell.
I made up my mind to go there.
I refreshed myself with a hot bath.
We need to repaint the barn.
How long does it take by car?
I'd like something to eat.
I'm very worried about your health.
Their trip was postponed because of the rain.
I have no idea what that could be.
I have good news in store for you.
It'll probably rain tomorrow.
There was a small box inside the big box.
He will not be able to do the work.
There is a lot of furniture in this room.
I give you two permission to do whatever you think is necessary.
I'm sure that I can do that.
I feel the same way about you.
They felt sure of success.
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
My mother has been dead these ten years.
Try to sleep.
Don't be late for school.
You should get married again.
His record is a new world record in the 100-meter dash.
I only hope I'm not too late.
It's kind of comforting.
That was a good trip.
History is merely repeating itself.
She should help her mother.
Tom asked Mary who had been the first to arrive.
I could not keep the tears from my eyes.
Let me introduce my wife.
If you have questions, don't hesitate to jump in.
I looked everywhere.
I like working with you.
We sat on the grass.
You said you were going to handle it.
There isn't anybody here.
Tom knew that Mary had done her best.
What kind of flowers do you like?
I felt depressed.
I don't have a passport.
His family did not have much money.
I was going to go.
This is the most comfortable chair I've sat on in a long time.
What a beautiful town!
Tom eats pizza with a fork, but Mary eats it with her hands.
He OD'd on cocaine.
I figured I might be able to help.
We're interested in observing the customs of different regions.
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
He is a poet.
He assumed full responsibility.
I think Tom is likely to go to Boston in the near future.
No one knew it.
Cut the bell peppers into two-inch strips.
It rained hard yesterday morning.
Maybe I need a new assistant.
We grew up together.
Does this hurt?
Both spellings are correct.
I have enough money to buy it.
Tom and Mary are devout Catholics.
Dancing is not a crime.
I don't know what motivated me to come here.
I don't have time to talk to you now.
You look positively ghastly.
I'm not going to work.
That might take too long.
Are you that stupid?
A trip to America is out of the question.
He is taller than his brother.
We'll pay for it.
You can do anything you want, depending on what floats your boat.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
Tom died at a very old age.
I think I'll go to Boston next weekend.
Who is that gentleman?
All your questions will be answered.
I hurried so I wouldn't miss the train.
I just don't know how to do it.
I dislike all of them.
Don't trample on the grass.
We're ready to put the boat in the water.
He came by car.
Just a moment, please.
I don't know who you are.
We can't avoid postponing our departure.
Do you have a fever?
I guess we were happy back then.
Mary has a flower in her hand.
He began his lecture with a humorous anecdote.
They shouldn't be doing that.
We have exams right after summer vacation.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Please turn down the music.
Close the door after you.
"Are scientists close to cloning a human being?" "Not by a long shot."
They were watching television.
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
Have a piece of pie.
Tom asked me to cut his hair.
I'll never be that famous.
You must be at the station by 5 o'clock.
I don't like feeling helpless.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
Tom has a high opinion of Mary.
To tell the truth, I didn't go there.
Tom wanted that.
Tom lives next door to us.
I'm auditioning for the part.
It pays in the long run to buy goods of high quality.
Stay away from my daughter.
Tom called in an expert.
I like her. She's so beautiful!
Shut that boy up.
Tom doesn't seem busy.
I don't know what you're so worried about.
She will give you what money she has.
When was this university founded?
Everybody needs one.
Can you deliver this?
You look so beautiful.
You need this.
They saved us.
I've never seen you so nervous.
Call me up at seven in the morning.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
Who wants some hot chocolate?
I hadn't planned to tell you about what happened last night.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
I hear some screaming.
She's getting on all right.
Who was that you were just talking to?
We were ambushed.
Are you going home by bus?
His leg was bitten by a crocodile.
He's an aristocrat.
Please have some copies made.
We considered that.
I also found this.
He is a man of wealth.
He's never been in love before.
This is not negotiable.
You won't find anything here.
Mine is better than yours.
He got lost while walking in the woods.
Mary kept on working in spite of her illness.
I intend to stay at a five-star hotel.
She lost her son in the war.
How many more are there?
My dad will kill me.
Don't stand near me.
There's something I feel you should know.
Tom told me that Mary was the one who told him that.
The political situation has changed.
I'm driving as fast as I can.
My uncle has completely recovered from his illness.
If you take this medicine, you'll feel better.
What do you call that?
A man who has never gone to school may steal from a freight car, but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad.
Justice will be served, whether here or in the hereafter.
I enjoy poker.
This would be catastrophic.
We stayed at a nice hotel.
I'm lying on the grass.
Guess what I found on the beach.
Let's just say no.
I feed my dog just before I eat dinner.
I'm not your daughter.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
Nothing is the matter with me.
He was staring at her.
My nose itches.
He didn't turn up after all.
I can't believe we're really living here.
I will be back in an hour.
I have finished.
I would do anything to get a job.
Let's take a rest in the shade.
I just wanted to make a gesture.
She didn't show up.
You should make sure that you get there on time. Tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late.
What would you have me do?
Tom went back to his own room and lay down.
It's about time you stopped watching television.
My house has a small yard.
He became a sailor.
It appears that he is a musician.
I don't like either of them.
He told me that he was busy.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
Tom had bruises all over his body after the fight.
Do you remember what you did last Friday?
What a disaster!
Tom wrote down Mary's phone number.
Tom often comes to see me on weekends.
Could we have a fork?
I think you should leave now.
I do that for the money.
This clock isn't working.
Take care of yourselves!
She forgave him for killing her father.
You were clearly mistaken.
Where is the exit?
Excuse me. Can you speak English?
I'm not a kid anymore.
They were enjoying themselves.
I saw my sister there.
A doctor was sent for at once.
He measured the length of the bed.
Would you like me to open the window?
Tom is a window cleaner.
Don't be ashamed of yourself.
Tom often walks to school.
May I speak to you?
It's all I want.
When do you mean to start?
I don't want a big wedding.
That's not how I want to be remembered.
Loosen the screws and remove the lamp cover.
Keep singing.
I haven't yet made up my mind.
He finished drinking one beer and ordered another.
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
I bought this book at the bookstore in front of the station.
I really don't understand anything.
Winter is right around the corner.
The company went public and became listed on the stock exchange in 1990.
I realized what was happening.
There is an urgent need for blood donors.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
Does someone here speak French?
Do I have to attend the party tonight?
He wanted to come with us.
Please continue until I tell you to stop.
They were prohibited from leaving the hotel.
They attempted to assassinate the president.
I want to join you.
When were potatoes introduced into Japan?
His story amused everyone.
This hat is mine.
The cat ruined my sofa.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Will you show me the picture?
An extremely terrible thing happened to him.
I worked hard all day, so I was very tired.
Mary took the cookies out of the oven.
He's working on it.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Don't talk to your father like that.
Are you saying you can't fix it?
He warned me of the danger.
London is small compared to Tokyo.
Tell me about the incident.
Get a job so you can support your wife and kids.
Do you know why?
She's terrified of talking to strangers.
I'll do it, if you insist.
Would you do me a favor?
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
Do you like rock and roll?
How do you help someone who doesn't want your help?
Men and women need each other.
Botany is the scientific study of plants.
You're very stylish.
Save your long-winded explanations for someone else.
Be quiet, girls.
No one can tell what'll happen in the future.
He was challenged to a drinking contest.
I get along with everybody.
That's just false.
He lost his balance and fell down.
Tom said Mary told him that.
I could use a drink.
You can't blame him.
Do you want something to eat?
Did you get his letter?
That made me cry.
He ran at full speed.
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
After a while passion and infatuation ooze away.
Tom will be back before long.
I went to bed a little earlier than usual.
Look at the meter.
I arrived at school on time.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
What's that stain?
You're weird.
Why don't you take the day off?
I saw you yesterday.
When I woke up, it was snowing.
I stayed at a cheap hotel.
Have you prepared everything for tomorrow?
He misses his father.
I really love her older sister a lot.
I was absolutely stunned.
I doubt if he will come on time.
I find swimming fun.
What did you get hit with?
Are you finished?
Tom says he'll be a bit late.
That law took effect today.
This is all I want.
I am off today.
Maybe there's a better way to do this.
If I had enough money, I could go abroad.
Will you please explain the meaning of this sentence to me?
You look happy today.
The family moved from their native Germany to Chicago around the year 1830.
I think you need a lawyer.
I'm going to stay here for several days.
I've removed the comma.
I made a mess of that.
You're very flexible.
Would you excuse me?
They gave us their word.
Are you still upset about what happened?
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
He exposed himself to danger.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted him to walk her home.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
My father came home at nine.
I want something to drink now.
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
I admit this may not be the best way of doing it.
That's not very original.
They said there was not enough time for a full investigation.
I got what you wanted.
Let me handle it.
You're not very tidy.
The girls giggled.
I don't know.
I'm going to prepare for the final exams this afternoon.
I wish that she would stop smoking.
Why are you so interested in him?
I'm at the airport now.
His brother is more patient than he is.
Don't lose heart now.
City life suits me very well.
I'm sorry, but it's past your bedtime.
I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. King.
I'm rarely invited to parties.
Is there anything you want to add to what I just said?
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
This movie is frightening to the children.
I couldn't let you do that.
I did some research.
We arrived three days ago.
I thought you'd never call.
Have your paper on my desk by Monday.
I only want what is rightfully mine.
Who told you the story?
He has another son.
They look like us.
Did you enjoy reading that book?
Do you think those are real?
Please turn in your homework by tomorrow.
Are you an only child?
What's Tom going to do next summer?
You can trust him with any job.
I did it the way he told me to.
They will not pass!
Aren't you embarrassed?
What should I do if Tom calls?
Have you heard from her recently?
Don't you get it?
I arrived here about five o'clock.
Freedom is not free.
You can't believe everything you hear.
He can't keep time.
I used to drink beer.
I will follow you wherever you go.
Tom has nobody to help him.
I have no doubt about it.
I have to tell her that the phone rang while she was gone.
It was nice of you to come all this way to see me.
I used to go swimming in the sea when I was a child.
Tom's free.
They had fun with us.
I found a solution.
We were late because of the storm.
In accepting the money, he lost the respect of the people.
You need to press the button.
Please make yourself at home.
Could you please tell me again why you are late?
I didn't expect you.
I appreciate anything you can do.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
Could you come back a little later?
I haven't eaten for many days.
She was educated by her grandfather.
I must see you.
They're in trouble.
Do you eat at home or eat out?
I'm not your son.
Thanks very much for doing this.
Tom is having a heart attack.
Why do you spend so much time watching TV?
He knows how to bet.
I don't really feel like reading.
Is there a souvenir shop in the hotel?
I am tired of hearing that.
Get rid of her.
If I had wanted your opinion, I would have asked for it.
I have as many books as he does.
That's all wrong.
Her job was to see the children safely across the street.
Are you getting much out of that book?
How long does it take to walk to your house from here?
She admired him.
I wish you were here with me now.
The man who is constantly making decisions and being compelled to alter them gets nowhere.
How much were the glasses?
My neighbor's son made fun of my daughter today at school.
You forgot your coat.
I surrender.
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
What is the news?
Tom doesn't know what he'll do.
Is that all right with you?
News of the recent blast is all over the radio.
I hear he is good at mahjong.
It's not too far.
Our eyes take time to adjust to the dark.
There is an exception to every rule.
I felt sad.
Do you know her father?
These are genuine.
I felt very sleepy.
Who broke it?
I didn't do it for you.
I plan to try reading some other books.
Now go have fun.
I'll miss you so much.
This is unbelievable.
How much time and energy do you spend on projects that don't make you any money?
Should we continue?
They declined our invitation.
You're probably tired.
I can't figure out how to operate this machine.
Please don't do it.
I gave you what you wanted.
I agree with your opinion.
This milk has a peculiar smell.
You'd better go home at once.
The brown horse is fast.
I thought you were working.
I told her what to do.
We'll all be there.
She looked at him with a smile on her face.
At least I did something.
I have great news for you.
We're very nervous about that.
He wanted to know more about the trees, too.
There will be a concert next Sunday.
Happiness is a delicate flower.
I'm not living with him anymore.
Is this about the other night?
Your car's on fire.
Is there somebody else here?
Tom will be surprised to see you.
What year were you born?
I think it's about time we got started.
I made these clothes myself.
After the meal, I asked for the bill.
I went to bed early because I was tired.
I'd like one more blanket.
Are you saying I have no sense of humor?
I never drink alone.
I wonder who invented it.
Where did they learn this?
I will do that work on condition that I get paid for it.
What's it used for?
He doesn't know me.
After the rain, there were puddles on the street.
He's a lovely young man.
It always happens this way.
Do we have any French homework that needs to be turned in tomorrow?
These politicians are corrupt.
It was handcrafted.
He would let me help him.
You need to be careful.
Whatever you do, you must do your best.
Tom tried to cheer Mary up.
I've been looking forward to meeting you again.
They're cold.
I thought we had found the perfect hiding place, but the police found us.
Will he be here soon?
You'll come back, won't you?
The first goal seems achievable.
Where do you want it delivered?
It's a pity that you can't come.
You seem a little nervous.
I left my baby in her care and went shopping.
There's something I have to ask you.
It might rain tomorrow.
Let's shake hands.
That wasn't what Tom meant.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
You mean the world to me, you really do.
They don't know yet.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
I'm dying for a cold drink.
What woke you up?
I can't tell you what we did last night.
You have only to stand in front of the door. It will open by itself.
I think we'll be safe here.
The window was open.
The first issue that we have to confront is violent extremism in all of its forms.
Do you need some water?
I've almost finished listening to the album.
Would you like a single room?
Tom and Mary were talking in French.
Take off your socks, please.
This is theirs.
Was there anyone else around?
I'll wait outside.
It's no use pretending that you can't speak French.
Invite him over to watch a movie.
Show us what you've got.
That's not something I want to do.
Answer me.
The pyramids were built in ancient times.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
Never choose a vocation just because it is popular or sounds interesting.
Time for dinner.
This is a long list.
You really expressed yourself quite clearly.
He canceled the appointment at the last moment.
From an objective viewpoint, his argument was far from rational.
I don't suppose anything will happen.
You need written permission.
Tom wasn't thinking straight.
You have to be patient.
Thanks for your quick answer.
I don't see how that would help.
Just a minute.
I used my imagination.
Do you live alone?
There was a discussion on the measures.
The first stage is complete.
He clearly stated that point.
I'd like you to sing a song for me.
He struck a match, but quickly put it out.
You're not the only one.
The dog will not harm you.
Buy a book and read it.
You may choose any book you like.
We're persevering.
She made a good speech.
I thought you'd never get here.
I wish I could be more specific.
Tom looked at Mary and then winked at her.
I don't know what's happened.
They trusted you.
Don't call the police.
I know neither of them.
The dogs howled at the full moon.
Not everyone was celebrating.
Who's next on the list?
This is our house.
Could you check this for me?
Do you know when Tom will get back?
She urged him to study harder.
Cows give milk.
So what do you suggest?
She has the air of being a lady.
I feel sorry for you.
"Are the drinks free?" "Only for ladies."
You can't kill us both.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
Aren't you going to open the box?
Tom drinks a lot.
I was lonely.
In those days, I used to get up at six every morning.
Is there something you want to ask?
My father drives safely.
Rabid dogs usually foam at the mouth.
Come quickly!
Your mother has made you what you are.
It looks like an apple.
He went off in a hurry.
I'm glad I invited you.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Manpower was no problem.
That's not love.
You're safe.
I thought you didn't care about money.
Would you like to know how I did that?
I was caught in a shower and got drenched to the skin.
She cooks for him every day.
Who picked you for this mission?
I'm glad you decided to come.
I want to know who sent you.
Don't take it to heart.
Tell me where to put these books.
I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?
Children often cry just because they want some attention.
Do you need a ride?
This thin book is mine.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
I was home-schooled.
Take a walk every day.
I'll never forget.
I was talking about something else.
I can't remember how much I paid for it.
By the time you land at Narita, it will be dark.
Who are you going with?
You can't kill us all.
You must pay attention to his advice.
I think everyone looks back on their childhood with some regret.
I will choose one.
This is my favorite place in this city.
We got off on the wrong foot.
Are you here alone?
There was no hurry.
Doesn't anyone want to speak to me?
I know what you are thinking.
Astronomy is by no means a new science.
Your friends are waiting for you.
Are the children already asleep?
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
The objection is overruled.
I have almost no appetite.
Our bike tour of the French Alps lasted two weeks.
You don't want to point that gun at me.
You don't have to answer.
Wait a minute.
I'll call you later today.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
You are gorgeous.
He was proud of his daughter.
We are a family of five.
Tom told us about what he did in Boston.
I've made up my mind.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
Not knowing what to do, I asked him for help.
I want to send this letter to Japan.
One's new. The other's old.
It's starting to snow.
They're alive.
Are you free tonight?
I've given up on the idea of buying a house.
I kept my word.
He is on the team.
I knew things about Tom that even his parents didn't know.
Tom thinks it would be better not to visit Mary right now.
Draw a small circle.
Wow! What a big box!
However, I'm not good at speaking English.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
What's that sound?
You got it all wrong.
Would you like me to tell the truth?
Have you told anyone else about this?
He's swimming now.
It is no good to you.
I'll make all the arrangements.
Accidents happen all the time.
What time did you wake up?
What is the difference between this and that?
He can't say anything to his father's face.
Where does Tom study?
I just banged my head on something.
I will go if you go.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
What could be the meaning of it?
Do you live in this dorm?
Nothing seems to grow in this soil.
He hates carrots.
Surprisingly, he swims even on cold days.
This road is too narrow for trucks to pass.
They kept talking all the time.
I really do just want to go.
They're mad at you.
Are you all completely crazy?
I'm glad we're all in agreement.
That can't be good for you.
Accidents will happen.
You're very upset.
You don't need to answer that letter.
Now that he is old, it is your duty to look after him.
We got stuck in a traffic jam, which made us twenty minutes late.
They arrived in England a week ago.
Have you finished your meal?
He didn't like to be punished.
The children got lost in the woods.
"In my opinion," said the younger brother, "you are wrong."
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
Tom found the problem.
I want to live here.
Where do I go then?
You should go to bed early.
Bring me a dry towel.
I can speak French.
She ate her dinner.
How did that whole thing happen?
Proper qualifications are required for the position.

Tom doesn't like being told he's not old enough yet.
Do you have a twin brother?
They were yours.
He fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
You should always tell the truth.
That's unrealistic.
That soil is rich in humus.
I hope you understand that.
You're working hard.
He searched his pockets for the key.
I'm not going to do that unless you help me.
Do you think it'll stay that way?
I've been doing this longer than you.
Incidentally, this room doesn't have anything like an air conditioner. All it has is a hand-held paper fan.
No one knows her name.
We all know.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
This book is interesting.
Tom wants to buy some books.
You did something incredibly stupid.
Looking at his face, you could tell that he was annoyed.
Get out of this car.
Are you the owner of this house?
I will stay at home.
Read all the instructions carefully.
I need an escort.
Keep to the left, please.
That's peculiar.
We saw them leave.

He is not the man that he used to be.
Pick a date.

He complained that he couldn't find a job.
Do you know why?
Is this a joke?
This party is kind of boring, don't you think?
I don't allow it.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
I have no idea how many people will be at the picnic.
He is equal to the job.
Who all knows about this?
She promised to marry him, but she didn't.
How much does this cost?
Do you want the job or not?
I just got that.
Put that in writing.
Don't call anybody.
No matter how hard I try, I can't remember the exact words.
We're unlucky.
I'm sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
Aren't they adorable?
I suppose I'd better be more careful the next time.
He slept with the window open.
I can't remember all their names.
A little bird told me.
Open your book to page ten.
He has mutton chops.
Don't exceed the speed limit.
She passed out on the floor.
What Tom did was very stupid.
I want the whole world to know that we're in love.
I will sleep at my aunt's.
And with that we finish the activities for today.
They've all gone crazy.
If you can't explain it easily, you don't yet understand it.
He has a vivid imagination.
Who's the highest bidder?
"How much did you pay for this?" "About 20 euros." "Wow! That's incredibly cheap."
I didn't know about that until quite recently.
You left your keys in the door.
You won't need those.
I bought a house.

You're the first person I told that to.
Let's play baseball!
I'm at the end of my rope.

I want to see him very much.
Everything was working.
I got hammered last night.
I'll find friends wherever I go.
I've managed to persuade Tom to come.

I see tears in your eyes.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
He shared in my happiness.
I know that I'm supposed to enjoy this class, but I don't.
Are there enough chairs for everyone?
How many days will it take if I send this as registered mail?
He's coming closer.
I'm not sleepy.
You're a very sound sleeper.
I'll ask later.
I'm ruined.
Do you ever sleep?
I can't pick this lock.
I'm too busy to talk to you now.
It's bad for business.

He thought that it would be interesting and fun.
Judging from her appearance, she seems to be very rich.
I've drawn a map.
Give me some more tea.

That's enough.
I sometimes skate.
The floorboards creak a bit when you walk across them.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

That is essential.
He has no interest in politics.
I found a nice restaurant.
A white dove is on the roof.

Did you get the check?
The cops are looking for the gang's hideout.
You should try to form the habit of using your dictionaries.
Of course you can trust me. Have I ever given you a bum steer before?

Are you thinking about getting a job?
Everybody already knew that.
Take your coat in case it rains.

We need a distraction.
Did you understand me?
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
Tom started climbing.
I don't expect you'd remember.
I won!
I'd like to wake Tom up myself.
I want to know what's funny.
My uncle has a deep interest in art.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.

Her family is very large.
Be serious.

I feel blue.
Is Tom doing okay?
I'm absolutely sure!

Watch my back.
Tom isn't the same age as Mary.
What brand of cigarettes do you smoke?
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their natural talents.
Do you have a twin brother?
I wish we could do that.
Tell me how I can help you.
We're the problem.
Wait a second.
Do you know what she said?
The tape recorder was on the table.
They are exhausted.
You're very sophisticated.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
She advised him not to smoke.
I needed to justify why I was earning such a large salary.
We must leave immediately.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
I hate to complain.
I figure that she will succeed in her business.
I can hear perfectly well.
That's all she wrote.
You're sleepy.
I'm sorry, I don't really remember.

I don't like to paint.
I met Mary yesterday.
I need a doctor.
I have to finish what I started.
Did I give it to you?
Many people act like that.
I asked the boy to throw the ball back.
We don't have to go.
I hope you'll come.
I had to see you again.
Get out of there.
You're very generous.
Are you going or staying?
We meant well.
I saw Tom kill the neighbor's cat.
I can't feel it.
Have you ever been lonely?
I'm sorry I said that.
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
He gave away all his money.
They talked all night.
I know you must be afraid.
My husband and I are both teachers.
I feel like my head is going to explode.
Did I tell you that?
Don't make me kill you.
He wished he had more time.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
I really don't want to go to Boston with Tom.
The truth is I told a lie.
You should see what Tom can do.
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
What if someone finds out?
I said I liked it.
He is anxious to know the result.
How long did it take you to write this report?
Is your mother here?
He came from another country.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I just want to be able to support my family and myself.
What happened after that?
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
What's your full name?
He never gets invited to parties.
I don't know how to contact you.
We adopted an alternative method.
Are they taking good care of you?
I didn't want to look foolish.
It requires more courage to suffer than to die.
Why didn't you do that?
My uncle gave me a book yesterday. This is the book.
That's one of them.
That didn't go very well.
You have lipstick on your cheek.
He's greedy and ruthless.
I hope they're friendly.
It was very disappointing.
That was only a year ago.
I don't trust you at all.
I often go fishing in that river.

Why did the police arrest Tom?
Do you have to do this every time?
He loved her very much.
Not everything can be explained.
You look satisfied.
Get down from there.
A man of wealth has to pay a lot of income tax.
Act like a man.
There are turtles that are more than two centuries old.
We aren't that poor.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
He is anything but a gentleman.
Did you enjoy that?
I didn't like it.
I'm late.
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
I don't want to shoot you.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
You must be very busy these days.
It took all day.
You'll like it, believe me.
If you feed your dog properly, you can increase his lifespan.

Is it a wolf?
Strangely enough, he failed.
I love sitting on the beach.

Why not see the doctor?
Sit down and shut up.
That was a close call.
What's the matter with you?
Tom says he will never go there again.
My best friend is in Rome now.
Get on with it.
He's much more into her than she is into him.
He never goes out after dark.
He was raised in the United States, but his native language is Japanese.
What time did the meeting end?
My sister hit the jackpot!
I am not used to being spoken to in that rude way.
I have been living here for a long time.
Tom got out of the bathtub and dried himself with the new towel that Mary had given him.
What's the hurry?
He negotiated a lower price with the real estate agent.
Out of twenty students, only one has read the book.

How did you come to hear of it?

I don't get the connection.
Please smile.

Don't try to talk right now.
There are many rats on the ship.
Have a seat, won't you?
You can not miss it.
Tom bought himself a new sports car.
Did Tom kill himself?
Tom wants you to buy him a ticket, too.
Do you have a fishing license?
How do you want to handle it?
You had better not drive a car.
Are there survivors?
Don't even say that as a joke.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
That's not funny at all anymore.
You think you're pretty funny, don't you?
Do you know where she was born?
You have to ask me for it.
Keep quiet.
I feel flattered.
The prisoners were set free.
Humans can't live on Mars.
Yeast makes beer ferment.
I hate fanatics.
We're meant for each other.
You may take anything you like.

Why don't I have a girlfriend?
I will never see him.
This sentence needs to be checked.
That's probably true.
I need an escort.
Can you recommend a good restaurant for dinner?
What's he doing there?

I don't think you ought to.
He tried to unify the various groups.
You're not going to do it, are you?
She came very near to being run over by a car.
I think we've wasted enough of your time.

Maybe we can fix it.
Take a bite.
I'd like to book three seats.

It's your problem, not mine.
I don't buy that.
He is not aggressive enough to succeed in business.
You're out of time.
I was caught in a shower on my way home from school.
It's 50 yen.
He doesn't earn enough money to live on.
I don't like those people.
May I have the check, please?
My father is so old that he is hard of hearing.
You're the teacher.
You look kind of down.
Do you have an opinion?
I think I did something wrong.

You have such a wonderful eye for detail.
Tom told Mary that their relationship was over.
Wash up.
Where did everybody go?

He is not like he seems.
We must never do this again.
When can you start?
I'd prefer to talk later.
I can't believe it's that simple.
You're big.
Something had to be done.
Tom needs to remember that.
Assuming your story is true, what should I do?
I'm your biggest fan.
What's the plan?
You must leave.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you to do.
I count on your help.

I would do it again.

I get the picture now.
If you need anything, let me know.
He went out to eat.
That's not how it works.
Has it occurred to you that you might be the one with the problem?
Japan has caught up with Europe and America in medicine.
Can you make me a snack?
I don't like your taste in color.
Can I see this one?

We have to do something to stop this from happening again.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
Don't hurt anyone.
What's behind the door?
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
I had a hunch you would do that.
What are we supposed to do?
Put away your wallet.
I hadn't planned to tell you about what happened last night.
I gave Tom detailed instructions.
Tell me if you're going to give it to him or not.
I'm not letting you go.
Be nicer to your sister.
Tom is exactly like his father.
You are important.
It looks like Tom is in love.

He went to America for the purpose of studying American literature.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Tom needs to leave early today.
It's perfect.
Tom told Mary that he thought a hippopotamus could run at a speed of about 30 kilometers per hour.
Tom got back in the car.
It was a good day.
That's going to take a while.
These containers are airtight.
You gotta get more organized.
You're right, I think.
I think you're funny.
Everything you've heard is true.
I want that information as soon as possible.
I don't mean to challenge your theory.
I want to spend the whole day with you.
You're too hard on yourself.
You are imagining things.
I don't have any friends.
I'm here every night.
What time is your curfew?
Tom was absent from school last Monday.
We're all crazy.
He did it all out of kindness.
I can't picture Tom in a dress.
I won't return.
I can't tell you all my secrets.
They'll kill you.
What's it about?
My life would be completely empty without you.
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't been helping me.
I don't remember you asking me to do that.
The food is horrible.
Will you show me the way to the bank?
I do not trust him any longer.
She hugged him.
Nobody would listen to me.
I know where you live.
It's raining there.
I didn't know I was invited.
Why would Tom be here?
I just don't want to get your hopes up.
I can't tell you how long I've waited for this.
Do you think I could speak with Tom?
Where did he go?
Tom didn't look offended.
I don't like loose ends.
How many of your friends have beards?
I'm from Turkey.
He lives in this neighborhood.
I went out even though it was raining.
I'm not narrow-minded.
I just followed the recipe.
I like instrumental music.
You're the oldest.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
I appreciate you coming here.
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
If I were you, I'd think twice before going down that path.
The fugitive made a run for the border.
Tom has been smiling all day.
In any case, I must finish this work by tomorrow.
How do you feel about the proposed changes?
I like mahjong.
Why don't you give up smoking?
I'm invited to Tom's party tonight.
I wonder what Tom would do in a situation like this.
You must exercise more care in writing English.
We're losing.
Is there anything you want to say?
Do you know anyone from Boston?
I must have my work finished by tomorrow.
My husband was probably drunk when he signed this.
I'm concerned about it.
Tom said it was on his desk.
It is impossible for a growing child to keep still for an hour.

Have you told everyone when and where the meeting will be?
I was glad to see my old friends.
I should be happy.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
Who won the contest?
I was sitting behind Tom.
Are you going to work until 10:00?
I'm going to be gone soon.
I haven't seen Tom since Monday.
Take out your notebooks.
I haven't sold one of those in weeks.
Let's see if we can help you.
I didn't know you could speak French.
Why don't you come visit us?
Tom hid under the bed with the cat.
You're very fortunate.
We talked without the aid of an interpreter.
They'll be here at three.
You're not helping much.
Who told you all that?
Don't read my diary.
Tom made a list of things he needed to buy.
I didn't mean to surprise you.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
You're safe.
He let me go.
Which one will you choose?
The leaves fell to the earth.
You intimidate Tom.
Hello! Fancy meeting you here! It's a small world, isn't it?
He is not wearing a hat.
I tried to cheer him up.
I'll show you that you're wrong.
Watching TV is a passive activity.
Did you hear all that?
I think we've seen enough.
Tom looks bewildered.

Do you really want to get more done?
What did you call me?
My work is finished.
You're blocking my light.
We chartered a bus.
We want to go.
You can't go outside.
All these books are mine.

We caught you.
We have the opposite problem.
How much are you being paid to do this?
Some people think the president spends too much time traveling.
Is reprinting this article a possibility?
You can trust him.
Go grab a drink.
I heard you switched majors.
I could never do that.
I don't want you to get the wrong impression.
A dog bit her on the leg.
They know us.
I don't understand what you mean.
Isn't it nice?
I don't know how to deal with this.

You'd better check that.

I hope he will get better.
I want you to come somewhere with me.

The world was on the very brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
This is a very sophisticated device.
They talked on the telephone every night.
They did not clap for us.
Don't be ashamed of being poor.
We have only two dollars.
I apologize for my rudeness.
I don't care how much you want it. I'm not going to give it to you.
She began to sweat.
Do you always help Tom with his homework?
You should have known better.
I just want to get it over with.
I'm completely wrecked.
We need both.
It's sad, but true.
I'm in way over my head.
It is no use trying to solve this problem.
Are you flirting with me?
You look stupid.
He is as tall as my father.
What caused the explosion?
There are statues in the park.
I saw a boy crossing the street.
We played baseball yesterday.

Why do you want to do that?
I was a little surprised.

Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
How come you don't know this?
I remember seeing him once.
I'm glad you invited me.
I think that's pretty obvious.
I have class in an hour.
You probably just want to be alone.

Kyoto and Boston are sister cities.
Would you say they match?

She was very surprised at the news.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you enjoy reading that book?
This packaging is hard to remove.
You don't look Japanese.
Will it bother you if I smoke?
I like to dress this way.
He's still at work.
Mention Mexico, and tacos come to mind.
Paris is one of the cities I visited last year.
You're disloyal.
What do Italians usually eat for lunch?
We'll try.
There is no hope.
I owe you so much.
Your bicycle is similar to mine.
I still have things left to do.
You've been warned.
A new difficulty has arisen.
Did you say something, dear?
CDs have taken the place of records.
Where did you go?
I built this for you.
Do you know whose car this is?
I thought you were trying to be funny.
You should try to see it.
Tom seems calm.
I don't care what you do with it.
Is it free?
I learned to milk a cow.
You killed my mother.
I just want to go to school.
I knew who my enemies were.
The bronze statue looks quite nice from a distance.
She struggled to get up.
Grab as much as you need.
These shoes cost too much.
How many times have you been there?
Let's hit the road.
I'm not talking about that.
Maybe we should just give up.
You want me to do your dirty work for you, don't you?
Tom advised Mary to go to the police.
We have to stop now.
Don't you drag me into this.
I'm not sure I want that.
I'll support him.
I was able to catch the last train because I walked very quickly.
I have no time tomorrow.
The French Revolution took place in 1789.
Tom likes cheese.
I have no one to say goodbye to.
The doctor advised me to take up some sport to stay in shape.
She didn't seem interested.
Everybody seeks happiness.
You shouldn't have gone fishing today.
You don't seem very pleased.
I want to sleep in my own bed.
Have you already finished?
I guess I was lucky.
I'll let you know when she arrives.
The coach gave me some advice.
You should take the number 5 bus.
He arrived at the station out of breath.
He's got a rap sheet as long as my arm.
I got up to go and look outside.
She is a nurse.
Where is this train going?
I'm a careful man.
Lie still.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
What have you heard?
That's what I'm always telling Tom.
I don't think I really matter to you.
Tom doesn't have Mary's address in Boston, but he has her phone number.
You're incredibly talented.
Are you playing games with me?
Whose computer is this?
Leave me a message, please.
You can't keep this a secret.
I thought I was alone.
I have too many things on my mind these days.
We have to expect the worst.
You've found it.
Can I tell you guys something?
He stole my heart.
I saw the moon above the roof.
Much as I'd like to come, I'm afraid I'll be too busy.
I was never a very good athlete.
You're very upset.
I have two cameras.
You look like somebody I went to high school with.
We're counting on you to help.
I'll find out soon enough.
Tom was sent back to Boston.
Are you aware of what's happened?
You're perfectly right.
You can't count on Tom's help.
Could I talk to you in private?
I'm just helping out.
Never rub your eyes after cutting a hot pepper.
I had a bad day today.
Let's sit up front.
You cannot take back what you have said.
When I woke up this morning, I felt sick.
Do you need a ride?
I remember having seen her somewhere.
The light in Tom's room is on.
I will sue you.
That's a huge organ.
No matter how hard he tried, my opinion didn't change.
He didn't see a thing.
The dog followed me.
He was elected president.
Tom felt like the luckiest man on earth.
A man is picking out a tune on the guitar.
I'm not supposed to drink.
Did you put it somewhere?
I need some get-up-and-go.
We visited our father's grave.
I bowed politely.
I'm praying for Tom.
When did you go to work?
From now on, I will not use that word.
Birds build nests.
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me.
We have three options.
Who brought this?
I'll excuse your carelessness this time.
Do you live alone?
Tom didn't even know it was here.
You have to hurry up.
He always keeps appointments.
I was drinking tea all morning.
At last, they were reconciled.
I want to ask you something.
You must work hard to succeed.
She gave him the brush off.
They showed it to our company.
Why was I not aware of this?
I'm not exactly surprised.
We were undefeated.
I'd like to borrow fifty dollars from you.
That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
They went on a trip abroad for the first time.
The man who wrote this book is a doctor.
I can't afford a new car this year.
I don't know either girl.
I arrived at school on time.
I could've gone last week.
I heard a voice I didn't recognize.
What she said is wrong.
This is not funny.
I had to do this today.
I should've warned you.
They are probably all dead now.
We worry about your future.
We just fed the baby.
Please follow me.
I have no choice.
Why are you being mean to me?
It is a pity that he has no sense of humor.
Where's the soap?
It's common courtesy.
What's new with you? How is your new job working out?
The key is in the door.
You're the one who should pay the bill.
You would look stupid wearing your mother's dress.
I thought I was alone here.
His daughter is sick.
We have half a dozen eggs.
This photo was taken by Tom.
Tom said we'd find you here.
I'll leave it up to you.
We know our problems.
Father took his place at the head of the table.
This bracelet is very inexpensive.
The teacher omitted the exercise on page 21 of the book.
I'm dieting.
Don't answer that.
I didn't know Tom was going to Boston with Mary.
I'll send you a postcard.
I may know someone who can help you.
I failed miserably.
You can never be happy if you feel envious of other people.
Tom hates me as much as I hate him.
What kind of girl are you?
I wanted to pay.
I never for a moment imagined we wouldn't get home before the storm hit.
I was born in 1979.
Of course, he is right.
Don't argue with a woman when she's tired.
He climbed over the fence.
How will you change this?
When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere.
Can you make sense of this poem?
I don't hear a thing.
Where did I put my glasses?
He left without saying goodbye.
Who do you trust?
It's not dinnertime yet.
Manuela's dresses are very elegant.
The clouds hid the sun.
Feel this. It's really soft.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Everyone looked puzzled.
She advised him to get more exercise.
She prefers beer to wine.
Your zipper is open.
I found a nice place to have a picnic.
What's that look like to you?
Tom feels better now.
I dislike speaking in public.
The first round is on the house.
Come here and help me.
I took a long nap after lunch.
His opinion was unimportant.
I realized that I didn't want to spend any more time dealing with that problem.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
I don't want to get married.
I still think we should've invited Tom to go with us.
You'll find a solution, I'm sure.
We were ordered to do that.
It's very hot, isn't it?
I gave her all the money I had.
There are around three thousand mosques in Istanbul.
Tom won't admit it, but he's secretly in love with Mary.
You'll have to work hard if you want to pass the exam.
I hear you've got a new girlfriend.
I got on the wrong train.
He betrayed his country.
How do you know that you can't do it unless you try?
Where's the nearest supermarket?
She avoided answering my questions.
I was stung by a bee.
I will visit my uncle in Kyoto this summer.
Parents must provide their children with proper food and clothing.
Why are you sitting alone in the dark?
I know all that.
This is a lot more fun than I thought it would be.
Do you actually think Tom will do that?
Is that going to happen soon?
Who exactly were they?
If you don't leave, I'm calling the cops.
What subject do you think he is interested in?
His slacks are all wrinkled.
I'm clean.
She came back soon after five o'clock.
Girls say that all the time.
Tom is still alive.
Now, it's time to celebrate.
How many kids do you have?
Today, I'm not going to school.
Traffic lights work all the time.
How much are these shoes?
I'm very busy today.
I'm getting up at six o'clock tomorrow morning.
There is an urgent need for peace talks.
He tries hard.
Why are you acting like this?
I was very flattered.
Tom walked out of the room.
The restaurant was far from the train station.
I don't like the way you're acting.
Do you have plans for tonight?
She showed him the photo.
Can they see us?
I don't think I'll go today.
Yesterday my bicycle was stolen while I was doing some shopping.
I have to talk to you alone.
There is an apple on the desk.
Will you look after my baggage?
Sheep are bred for their fleece and their meat.
He is a lazy fellow.
This is your fault.
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
That couldn't be helped.
He knows about the modern history of France.
It's a scalp disease.
I'm better than him.
Where did you put my gloves?
Let some fresh air in.
She did it carefully.
I've got something else on my mind.
What are the children doing in the garden?
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
He will look after the cats for me while I'm abroad.
You blew it, Tom.
I had no idea you'd be here.
Don't let go. Hold on tight.
Tom needs help.
His new book met with a favorable reception.
He has lots of new ideas.
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
I thought this was a hospital.
You can't have both books.
I saw him crossing the road.
Tom ate quickly.
We're both witnesses.
It is necessary for you to go.
He is a teacher at our school.
I felt as if I had no choice.
Tom gave us lots to eat.
You should apologize for your rudeness.
Our train arrived on time.
Stay calm.
I have problems concentrating.
Who said that?
That wasn't Tom's choice.
The fat man jumped over the ditch and fell to the ground.
I was in prison for three years.
I'm your friend.
Please remain seated.
You can't help yourself.
"I would love to go to the dance with you." "Really? You would?"
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Please put yourself in my place.
Who was that woman I saw you with?
I've got nothing in my fridge.
Tom held Mary in his arms.
It was a suicide bombing.
You said you wanted the truth.
I know what you want to do.
I should go with you.
You're the only person I know who can help me.
I nearly starved.
Dance with me.
We were all present at her wedding.
I feel the same way as you do.
His speech inspired all the boys.
Have you ever been stuck in an elevator?
Tom told me he was working.
He gathered the courage to decline the offer.
They're looking for you.
How many men named Tom do you know?
We should hang out more.
I returned the knife which I had borrowed.
I wouldn't care.
Tom is hard up for money.
They're just for you.
I need help painting the fence.
I have a previous engagement at ten.
Don't take it so literally.
You're touching me.
It's an outrage.
It doesn't work, does it?
There are a lot of fish in this lake.
That's just what I need right now.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
You should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.
You must quit drinking.
We have a lot of snow at this time of the year.
What gate do I board at?
Are you dyslexic?
I figured you'd understand.
How will you manage without a job?
I don't understand what's bothering you.
My son is a journalist.
If you need anything, just call.
Finally, I found the answer to your question.
We waited in the movie theater for the film to start.
Why did you get so angry?
Tom speaks French very well.
I'll have it here for you tomorrow.
She bought him a dog.
Though he is rich, he is not happy.
I usually drink a lot of milk.
We love our customers.
I made a few modifications.
She turned off the lights so she could enjoy the moonlight.
He was educated by her grandfather.
They aren't the kind of people you should want to be friends with.
I wouldn't care.
Hitler led Germany into war.
There is no antidote.
He narrowly escaped death.
He could not hold back his tears.
I guess you think you're pretty special, don't you?
I'll pay attention. I promise.
The fishermen took photos of their catch.
I can't use it.
I'm going to explain all this in more detail later.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
A few days later, he came.
A dollar is equal to a hundred cents.
Tom is someone I really look up to.
It being Sunday, the shop was closed.
Don't worry. I've got you covered.
He will soon be a father.
Do you know what Tom was wearing?
She waved her hand to me.
Please be sure to take one dose three times a day.
Are you responsible for this mess?
Tom and Mary are vegetarians.
Why does it make you angry?
Do you want to see her very much?
What do you want to do after you graduate?
She is busy preparing for the trip.
He gave me his phone number.
You're unambitious.
You're afraid, aren't you?
She took advantage of our hospitality and stayed a whole month without paying us anything.
I sure am cold.
That's not entirely true, is it?
The whole world hungers for peace.
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
It's obsolete.
Tom gave me some money.
Let's take a 10 minute break.
They made their way across the river.
I will go with you after I have eaten my lunch.
This yearbook is illustrated with a lot of beautiful photographs.
Are you ready for the trip?
He held out his hand and I took it.
What's the big hurry?
Don't look down on him just because he's poor.
She's not old enough to get a driver's license.
I've been working here for many years.
I want to know how you know that.
She asked him to come into her house.
I love to party.
I'll give you a book.
She drinks a little wine at times.
She's rather good.
I captured butterflies with a net.
Tom needs to be at today's meeting.
You can't tickle yourself.
Are your parents home?
Where's the toilet?
There was a cherry tree growing in the garden.
You don't seem too happy to see me.
There's a stowaway on the ship.
What's the name of the company you work for?
They're not bad.
To the best of my knowledge, the lake is the deepest here.
I went outside early in the morning.
Is that a challenge?
I know some students in that school.
Tom wants a new cell phone.
I haven't eaten.
Tom isn't a good swimmer.
I only found out a couple days ago.
You're still young.
I'll be checking on you.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
What sort of information do you get on the Internet?
Tom was making French fries.
I love to hear a grandfather clock chime.
I ran across the field.
I can't open this bottle.
Tom never was ambitious.
He isn't able to buy a car.
Where did you go?
I hope we have better weapons than the enemy does.
Tom's a doctor.
I just can't believe this.
Tom went home with Mary.
This road connects Tokyo with Osaka.
It wasn't easy.
I realize it's probably too late.
That one over there's really cute.
I don't care who your father is. You still have to follow my orders.
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
I think you're ready.
I'll cooperate.
I work at the embassy.
Do you always greet people that way?
I'm just a poor student.
I'm afraid I can't save you this time.
Don't be so negative.
I don't care as long as you are happy.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
You're no doctor.
His nose bled.
I know where he lives.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
Does that suit you?
Do you think the shooting was accidental?
Why don't you give me a break?
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
I ordered the book from England.
She surprised me.
She turned down our proposal.
What else do you want to do?
Leave your umbrella in the hall.
It was five years ago that I graduated from college.
I thought I heard someone in the kitchen.
This is how it works.
That's my dog.
He paid no attention to my advice.
I don't plan to vote in the upcoming elections.
Don't tell anyone.
We'll get there.
They have no choice.
That's a very nice suit.
I don't have the ball.
Why are we wasting time with this?
It didn't even cross my mind.
I look forward to corresponding with you.
As soon as he went out of the house, it began to rain.
I'm not a drug addict.
He doesn't have enough experience.
Her father became an invalid as a result of a heart attack.
Tom doesn't smile very often.
I am surprised by a lot of the things he does.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
She was very excited.
Where's the pharmacy?
They gave me a ten percent discount.
She decided to take legal advice.
Are you serious about getting married?
You can use my bicycle.
Tom stepped on Mary's foot.
Tom bought a leather couch.
Thanks for the info.
I don't know how to do this.
Have you ever done any volunteer work?
I know I can count on every one of you.
That's all we talk about.
Have yourself a drink.
You said you were going to handle it.
This textbook is good.
It's clear from his actions that he loves her.
Where can I leave my bike?
He adhered to his own theory.
He seems very pleasant.
Spain will need to borrow 100 billion euros.
I've got to stop eating such sweet ice cream.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
I've got a rope in my trunk.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
Aren't you tired?
He will make a good doctor.
It is not easy to get rid of a bad habit.
I said I liked it.
Why are you so happy?
How good are you?
She insisted on my going there.
I'd like to ask you about how to do that.
All at once they began to laugh.
Tom fired Mary.
Everybody needs help sometimes.
What were they doing here?
I want you to be prepared.
I want to help you figure this out.
It's not always possible to eat well when you are traveling in this part of the world.
Cats are nocturnal animals.
I want Tom to go get me something to eat.
Everything that you say may be used against you.
Your question is not relevant to the subject.
He won't be pleased.
We had fun with them.
Choose your favorite racket.
He is enjoying his school life.
We all knew that it would happen sooner or later.
I don't need any help.
I know you recently retired.
I didn't sign up for this.
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
We're just scared.
I have an appointment with my lawyer today.
I am sixteen years old.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
He is unsatisfied with the result.
Who's your father?
I was afraid of being put into a closet.
I wish she were alive now.
He drives a car, doesn't he?
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
This is how I feel.
I read a book while eating.
What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
Tom set the table for dinner.
Did you have fun last night?
I'm going to miss this place.
My robot's name is Multi.
She put on socks.
I should tell you something.
Who's their mother?
I think that's a good plan.
Follow him.
As we ate our meal, we talked about what we had done that day.
To drive a car, you need a license.
I don't think that's the solution.
How long are they?
When did you hear about it?
He was born in Athens in 1956.
The engineer told us how to use the machine.
This is nice.
What're you all dressed up for?
Tom told me he was depressed.
She is no less charming than her older sister.
She was breathing hard.
The whole neighborhood was surprised at the news.
It's been a long time since I've written anyone a letter.
We're at the bank.
He was the last person I had expected to see during my stay in America.
What do you think I should write?
Tom is my personal assistant.
Tom has to go even if it rains.
You caught me off-guard.
Each of the three boys got a prize.
Would you come with us?
It won't hurt you to skip one meal.
I think they did it on purpose.
I had to run to catch the bus.
Please take a look at this picture.
This doesn't seem normal to me.
Do you have health insurance?
Tom has never seen a UFO.
Elephants in Thailand are as common as kangaroos in Australia.
She stammers when she feels nervous.
They were acting strangely.
She went shopping.
Nothing like that will happen again.
I'm not fighting.
You could've killed somebody.
Do I have to leave a deposit?
Could you please fix this?
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
You have some books.
How can you be so cruel?
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
We do everything together.
Send for a doctor at once.
I went to sleep as soon as I got home.
This is how it is.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
How are you feeling this morning?
You smell good.
I have a little money with me.
I'm no different.
This word has two meanings.
I believe they're a perfect match.
Tom will fix it.
Do you really think Tom can hear us?
That isn't what I'm looking for.
The president's son leads the special forces.
I'm sure you're going to enjoy it.
That feels very nice.
I thought you should see this contract.
You seem busy.
I'm innocent.
Just relax.
That's what Tom promised.
I'd be careful.
How long were you at the party?
I want to keep one.
This experience will be invaluable as a way of improving the way I study English.
The boy made a paper plane.
Are you ready to do that?
Don't read that kind of book.
Accidents happen all the time.
She made me a cake.
I don't mind it here.
You seem depressed.
Don't let the cat escape. Close the door!
He speaks Arabic.
He works at night.
She quoted a poem by Keats.
What time is it by your watch?
I think they're a good team.
Don't forget to answer his letter.
Don't say another word.
How was the French class?
I told Tom we were friends.
I'm really bad with names, but I never forget a face.
Please sit down!
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.
Currently, he's our best batter.
I thought you might be upset.
Stock prices fell sharply.
I didn't see it happen.
I wanted to run away with Tom.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
I like playing football.
After we walked for a while, we arrived at the lake.
I was afraid that I might hurt his feelings.
I arrived too late and missed the train.
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
Please let me take your picture.
She is good-natured.
I've already memorized your phone number.
I fell asleep while I was doing my homework.
I am far from satisfied with the result.
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.
We had to stop.
This word comes from Greek.
You're poisoning me.
Don't you all agree?
I'm going with Tom.
We're the best.
We have to stop him from drinking any more.
I know where Tom lives.
Who's replacing you?
Our house was built in 2013.
I gave you explicit instructions not to touch anything.
You're not being rational.
Am I really the only one here who doesn't understand French?
They're self sufficient.
Look at my new car.
Tom and Mary are both thirty, but they look much younger.
The phone is out of order.
Your cat is driving me crazy.
I don't know when he'll come back.
I'm leaving town for a few days.
Let me try that.
I'm three years younger than you.
Tom cooks for us every day.
What keeps you up so late?
Everybody in the audience sang along.
Let Tom decide.
I like to add basil to season my spaghetti sauce.
Nobody's perfect.
He dislikes the principal.
When it comes to sweets, I just can't control myself.
I'm glad things went so well.
I did it many times.
Tom talks very loud.
Tom seems lost.
Go away.
They asked his older brother to help them do their homework.
Is he a teacher?
Experience is the best teacher.
I don't have any objection to that.
When I speak Japanese, I sound like a child.
My credit cards are maxed out.
Tom is older than your father.
Tom could swim when he was three years old.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
It's easy to do that.
The unemployment rate went up to 5%.
Please fix it.
The two pieces were glued tightly together.
You have no right to do this.
What is missing?
I was interviewed for a job.
I think it's time for me to buy my son a car.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
She wanted to spare him embarrassment.
They fit each other so perfectly.
He attempted to swim across the river.
Tom isn't sure he has to do that.
That's a very interesting question.
Hurry up and you can still catch your train.
It rained heavily all day long.
Tom is in critical condition.
The thieves divvied up the proceeds from their heist.
I can't dance either.
A pound is a unit of weight.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
I have serious doubts.
That's free.
You spilled your coffee.
This is a great victory.
Tell me more about yourself.
You don't have to pay.
You don't have to come see me.
How would you describe yourself?
Is your suitcase as heavy as it looks?
Put this in your backpack.
I thought you were in charge.
No one left.
Taxis are expensive.
I'll have the same.
Tom really likes chocolate.
I have two dogs, three cats, and six chickens.
We're all going to die anyway.
He was imprisoned.
Please feel free to ask questions.
She has to take in the waist of her pants a bit.
I need you.
Have you ever been married?
We're working as fast as we can.
Don't you think I know my own father?
Some of the roses in my garden are white, and the others are red.
My wife has faults. None the less, I love her.
You're the only one who can do this.
I would've told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
Tom can't speak French. Mary can't speak French either.
Tom couldn't hide his pain.
I bet you didn't know that.
That seems to make sense.
Please pull the rope.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
Tom will be delighted to see you.
This is my last offer.
You could stop this.
We like Tom.
I don't recognize over half of these names.
I don't like his rude manner.
I get very angry when you don't answer my questions.
How did you come by this painting?
She sank under the surface of the water.
I've heard enough.
What is your decision?
I'm going to the bank.
I'd never seen anything like it.
Tom greeted me politely.
We should determine what is to be done first.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
I can't see what you mean.
I had an amazing experience.
My body aches all over.
We're all infected.
Why not talk to her about it directly?
I knew I'd get blamed eventually.
I'm going to tell Tom that.
I fell in love with someone my parents didn't like.
I felt ill.
You ought not to have disclosed the secret.
How was your afternoon?
I like the way you talk.
Tom will continue.
What did the doctor say?
After his accident, he is happy to be alive.
I think his name is Tom.
Few politicians admit their mistakes.
She has a tattoo of a lizard on her thigh.
I don't even know how to dance.
I wear glasses.
I want a refund.
Would you like something to eat?
I want you to stay quiet for a few minutes.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
He was watching television all day.
I hope to pass my exams.
Do not call him master.
She is dead.
She went to see him in the hospital every day.
Tom is hiding something.
We're very different.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
I can't find Tom anywhere.
I don't like this.
I don't know which button to push.
Mt. Aso is an active volcano.
What time does it open?
They are making a salad.
Skip the boring chapters.
We got all the materials together.
What did you expect to happen?
They'll have to wait.
Wear warm clothes or you could get sick.
Are you in trouble?
Put it back.
Tom knows he did something wrong.
He threatened me, but I wasn't scared.
I understand your position perfectly.
As soon as he saw a policeman, he ran away.
She had gone to bed.
Is she all right?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
You're exhausted.
Scientists are debating his theory about the disappearance of the dinosaurs.
You have been warned.
He wanted to buy a book.
Tom told me you were in Boston.
I know her.
Lie still.
She explained to him why she was late.
Let's continue this tomorrow.
How long have you been waiting for the bus?
I laughed a lot.
What happened to him?
Don't be upset.
Did Tom break your heart?
I wanted to wish you well.
I was in charge.
She has a distinct English accent.
Did you find everything you want?
Do you deny that you went there?
What time is your appointment?
The atomic number for hydrogen is 1.
Can you tell me what is happening?
Some flowers bloom in the spring and other flowers bloom in the fall.
I can't carry all that baggage.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
You ought to have been more careful.
She wrote to me to come at once.
He was afraid of his wife.
He thinks that's normal.
Do you like the taste of beer?
The decision is not easy.
I love to see you laugh.
We're all disappointed.
If the spaghetti sticks when you throw it against the wall, it's done.
Have you read this book already?
I want to tell you the story.
Do you really think that your plan is realistic?
He should have known better.
This is nothing.
I'll never give up.
I am not used to staying up late at night.
Enjoy your holidays.
I was born here.
Where can we meet?
A liter of milk contains about thirty grams of protein.
I've heard that story already.
Let me show you how to do that.
I couldn't get a definite answer from him.
Did you enjoy that?
Are they still looking for us?
Everything went according to plan.
Don't underestimate your own strength.
Why are you busy today?
Something went wrong with my watch.
The leaves have turned red.
This room gets sunshine.
Did you hear my son play the violin?
Shut the door, please.
He never told anyone.
They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
Laughter is good for your health.
I'm rather shy.
I think they saw you.
Do you think animals have souls?
I bought a pair of shoes.
Can you drive a stick shift?
It cost a lot of money to repair the car.
You can't judge people by their looks.
They were listening to the lecture attentively.
I like it when it's cold.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
How did I let this happen?
The thick fog made it hard to see the road.
My aunt lives in a lonely house in the country.
How are things going with your youngest sister?
This seems risky.
Quality is more important than quantity.
If we had wings, could we fly to the moon?
Do you think Tom can find it?
He turned on the radio.
What woke you up?
Things took a sudden turn for the worse.
He confirmed that it was the wreck of the Titanic.
He came from another country.
You are a good cook, aren't you?
I heard a woman scream.
You need to call Tom immediately.
Everybody likes money.
All of them went there.
Tom wants to be a stuntman.
It's not a bad thing.
I don't ever want to hurt you.
I was uncomfortable.
I have to talk to somebody.
She put in for a raise.
Dial 110 at once.
He caught hold of the rope.
Did I give it to you?
It's not very good.
There is very little hope of his success.
Are you famous?
What I want is some peace and quiet.
I don't have a girlfriend.
They agreed to start early.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
This intersection is dangerous.
My father was no less affectionate and tender to me than my mother was.
How's your morning been?
I'd like you to take this.
Tom encouraged Mary.
Come at any time you like.
He had no coat on.
I'm just watching TV.
We had to wait until she found a chair and sat down.
You know I can't.
May I be of service?
That's enough for today.
His way of thinking is very childish.
When we borrow money, we must agree on the conditions.
Both Tom and Mary blushed.
Why don't you stay here?
Tell me how the robbery went down.
Show me your tattoo.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
The bottom 40% of the U.S. population has only 0.3% of the wealth.
I don't think Tom is listening to me.
I had to resign.
We had to alter our plans because we didn't have enough money.
Is it enough?
There is a bank in front of the station.
I like it when it's snowing.
We were attacked by swarms of bees.
Your room is ready.
Put your glasses on.
As long as we love each other, we'll be all right.
She was pleased with the new dress.
I can read.
It's as cold as ice.
Tom handed the key to Mary and she opened the door.
You're conscientious.
I'm dying.
The secret of life is hanging around until you get used to it.
You are completely wrong.
I think you can handle it.
Why do you want to study abroad?
Science can be used for good or evil purposes.
It was terribly cold yesterday.
I don't like meat.
She emphasized the importance of education.
He got more than he bargained for.
Everyone who knows him respects him.
We should hang out sometime.
I don't usually write this kind of song.
What if it's too late?
I always counted you as a friend.
That would be unethical.
Don't tell me to shut up.
They were really unlucky.
The rebels made a barricade across the road.
Tom checked Mary's pulse to see if she was still alive.
They abandoned the ship.
5 is less than 8.
Did anybody see anything?
That's not funny.
I won't buy one.
My car, which broke down yesterday, has not been repaired yet.
They blocked it.
Keep your hands up.
Fill out the questionnaire.
I can't understand the meaning.
I hope to own my own house someday.
This is extremely awkward.
What's the plan?
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
Heat is a form of energy.
I was not sure what to do.
When will they give a concert?
What's your hobby?
The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
How's the party going?
I felt relieved when my plane landed safely.
Everybody thought so.
My room has two windows.
Start writing.
This is my dog.
Your cake is very delicious.
I'll leave that up to you.
I'll call you at noon.
Both Tom and Mary were absent today.
The doctor cured her of her disease.
He's a hunk.
I walk to school.
Have they spotted you?
What with good fortune, and his own effort, he won the first prize in the contest.
Forward this to everyone you know.
Tom eats mostly fruits and vegetables, and only eats meat about once a week.
We'll go to church this evening.
What have you come here for?
My nose is itchy.
Do I know you?
You've run out of time.
He traveled by boat.
I can carry those suitcases for you.
I thought you might need help.
It's much too cold to swim.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
Tom seems more annoyed than angry.
The ambassador returned.
Everyone is looking forward to watching the game.
I need to know.
You're overreacting.
I pigged out on pizza.
Why don't you want to go first?
Tom learned sign language.
What size are these shoes?
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
What fruit do you like the best?
I have only half as many books as he does.
I had my brother put this room in order.
Birds make their nests in trees.
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.
You better hurry.
It was fun while it lasted.
He looks just like a skeleton.
Training for a marathon is taxing.
I won't do that.
I just don't want our luck to run out.
How is this relevant?
They fought for freedom.
I asked her for her address.
We're shy.
Everybody, get out of my house.
By the way, have you seen him lately?
I get goose bumps when I see a horror movie.
I want you to sleep on it.
It'll only take three minutes.
They might be taller than you.
I'm a changed man.
I was reading a book.
I can't believe you actually said that.
Tom saw a mouse.
When is the paper due?
Tom died in Mary's arms.
The boy made a paper plane.
This chimney is made of brick.
He complains all the time.
This dress is much too large for me.
When do you go on holiday?
I never want to see him again.
I'm certain that he'll come.
Hold the elevator, Tom.
Are you trying to be funny again?
According to the X-ray, everything is all right.
Owls are active at night.
I'm willing to apologize.
What were you two doing?
Are you going to the theater tonight?
Do you remember seeing me before?
I thought I'd lost you.
When he saw her letter, he felt somewhat uneasy.
Tom led the attack.
If you're not careful, you might have an accident.
He's the prom king and she's the prom queen.
You can't get rid of me.
I must object.
Recently, I moved to a new apartment.
May I see your invitation please?
I just need to stay calm.
I've never been to my uncle's house.
He lost both his parents at an early age.
I expect he'll pass the examination.
I can do it.
Take mine.
Are you dressed?
I'll get you a glass of water.
I'm as tall as Tom.
Our negotiations broke off.
When will you finish your assignment?
I had a job when I was your age.
I've already been shot twice.
You look very pale.
There is an urgent need for good legal advice.
What if he's wrong?
Swimming in the sea is great fun.
He missed the last train.
They're wrong.
My plan is different from yours.
Oats have long been food for horses and mules.
She didn't feel like eating lunch.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
We will defeat them.
Where do you want us to go?
I just had to see you guys before I left.
Do your homework right away.
He asked for a beer.
He is cranky.
He's smoking more than ever.
Is the school on this side of the river?
I really like your work.
You aren't busy now, are you?
He always puts himself first.
I wish I earned more money.
I hope my dream will come true.
I'm sure Tom will know how to do it.
Nothing lasts forever.
He is ill.
What time is your curfew?
He told me that I looked pale and asked me what the matter was.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
How could I refuse?
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me.
Would you like to sing?
Is that a threat?
Three of the hostages were beheaded.
He is pleased with his work.
I liked your friends.
I have a serious skin problem.
He seems to have told a lie.
Tom is hardly ever at home.
That's what you get for not listening.
Let's take a picture here.
Are you almost finished?
I still need to talk to you.
He's reading a novel now.
You need to be more careful.
I'm out of practice.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
You have given me so many.
Tom is afraid of making mistakes.
I haven't seen you around before.
The children love listening to fairy tales.
How can anyone sleep with all this commotion going on?
This bed is too soft for me.
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
I'm starting to get used to the food here.
Your suggestion seems reasonable.
He is anything but honest.
They're related to each other.
I didn't know that Tom didn't know how to do that.
My mother has gone shopping.
Has Tom eaten yet?
You can't live on that island.
He took off his glasses.
He tore his ligament.
What's your favorite wine?
It costs 2 euros.
A loophole in the law allowed him to escape prosecution.
He made the most of his opportunity.
What do you see in him?
Our school is 80 years old.
I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable.
He subscribed to Time magazine.
Thank you kindly.
She decided not to go.
You were the one who gave this to me.
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
Didn't your parents teach you anything?
That would be quite acceptable.
We missed the deadline.
A heavy tax was imposed on whiskey.
You've run out of time.
Tom has the necessary experience.
Didn't I tell you not to dance?
You didn't come here alone, did you?
Would you mind carrying it up the stairs for me?
Which cup is yours?
I often think about the place where I met you.
I am the fastest runner.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
Let's examine the numbers.
I can't get rid of my cold.
I don't believe that ghosts exist.
Let's keep each other company for a while.
I locked the door.
I'll show you the way out.
That's our best hope.
He's an old timer.
I like your house.
I'm at home.
Try not to be so tense.
They aren't telling us the truth.
The door was locked, so I couldn't get in.
What did you eat for breakfast?
He was absolved of all responsibility.
The ice is too thin to bear your weight.
He spoke well of her son.
Could you fill me in?
You don't know how bad I want to leave.
That's not uncommon.
You have no messages.
I appreciate all you've done.
The party was a success.
You need to be more patient.
I could never harm you.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
I will stop you.
You should eat.
Do you like football?
You're not dressed.
They laughed.
You must be in good physical condition.
I gathered from this letter that he was angry.
The leaves blew away in the wind.
You need to be more patient.
I wrote the wrong address on the envelope.
I bought an English book, but the book was hard to understand.
That's not bad.
I went to the park this morning.
He lives off the grid.
You're twisting my words.
You know that better than I do.
Television helps us widen our knowledge.
I've always paid the rent.
Sign the guest book.
I want to continue this discussion tomorrow.
That is what they study English for.
It's hard to understand his ideas.
I never should've listened to you.
My bike was stolen last night.
Tom put thirty dollars on the table.
I was quite shocked by this.
You're conscientious.
I as well as my brother am to blame.
I can't go back there and neither can you.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
My baby brother sleeps ten hours a day.
When was she born?
What are you doing these days?
I'm not eating this.
She had an unassuming air that put everyone at ease.
It is not my day.
You're courteous.
I had to get some help.
I'm kidding.
Don't sass me.
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
I'd help you if I could.
I need your answer by the end of the day.
It's about time I was going.
I'm not done with you.
Do you want in or not?
You are no longer welcome here.
Go grab a drink.
The risks are too great.
What's your dad's name?
I'm doing everything I can.
Who are we competing against?
I would like to kiss you.
I really must finish this.
As soon as I can afford it, I plan to travel around the world.
I'm totally confused.
She really got on my nerves.
I want to know where you plan to live.
I don't believe that anymore.
I didn't graduate.
Tom certainly knows how to entertain people.
I'm not mad.
Some people in the crowd fired back.
Do you have any questions?
I can't tell you any more, I've already said too much.
He's an excellent kisser.
This is an abomination.
Will you use this?
I felt scared.
I'll give you a ride home.
How did you get hurt?
I think watching people playing chess isn't much fun.
If we leave now, we could be back in Tucson before nightfall.
I'm glad that I didn't eat the food that made you sick.
Did you know him well?
Why don't you ride with me?
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
I have been living in Rio de Janeiro for four years.
You lost the game.
I'm psyched.
Kids are cruel.
She has about as many stamps as I do.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever held in my arms.
I'm really not busy.
He took a deep breath before entering his boss's office.
Where do they live?
Tom was a piano teacher.
That was no ordinary storm.
We're stunned.
I wish you were here with me.
Don't make me kill you.
He owns a good few sheep.
Do you speak French fluently?
Don't say a word to anyone.
Don't even bother coming.
This nation's economy is growing by leaps and bounds in recent years.
They're strong.
This is really low.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
I just think we need to be extra careful.
Push the door open.
He is not very good at mathematics.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary parked her car.
Tom didn't expect Mary to react like she did.
We went swimming at the beach.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
I'm not gambling anymore.
They slept in the same room.
Would you please send me a catalogue by mail?
Our school is fifty years old.
This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me!
I want to name the baby after you.
Her technique is superb, but she needs to play with more expression.
The lights aren't on.
He is lying through his teeth.
Be kind to little animals.
Add a tiny pinch of salt.
Compare the two carefully, and you will see the difference.
You must teach me what you know.
Could you please briefly introduce yourself?
We will make every effort to do so.
You can take it.
I got acquainted with her in France.
They might pay me more if I could use a computer.
We have some celebrating to do.
I'm still the boss around here.
What has changed since then?
We could meet downtown. Would that be convenient for you?
I'll certainly go and see him.
Can you sell the book to me for 500 yen?
I know he is busy.
You were afraid, weren't you?
There's been another accident.
Where were they going?
Like all dogs, he'll chase a rabbit if he sees one.
I'm sorry about last night.
It is under the chair.
She's a very wise mother.
He tried to give up smoking several times, but failed.
Tom is a good friend.
I don't like the tie that you're wearing.
Would you please stop talking?
You don't stand a chance.
Are you responsible for this?
I want you to stay where you are.
I'm a little child.
As far as I know, he did nothing wrong.
I'll drive you somewhere.
Can somebody get that?
What do you plan on doing tonight?
I have some powerful friends who can help you.
Tom came up with an ingenious idea.
What is the exchange rate today?
She fell down and broke her left leg.
Can I take my jacket off?
Is that really you?
I'm not talking to you, Tom.
Go on, Tom, we're listening.
I was quite shocked by this.
You forgot to buy lettuce.
I am a Muslim.
He writes scripts.
She keeps secrets.
This is the only one I have.
They decided on the date and location of their wedding.
Are you doing something special on your birthday?
Let's take care of business.
Are you there?
You are what you eat.
There is an apple under the desk.
Why are you so tired today?
At last, I caught up with my friends.
I can't afford to buy that.
Is it a social problem?
It is high time you spilled the beans.
The joke's on you.
I could help.
That sounds awesome.
She managed to keep up appearances.
I really thought I could do it.
This table is heavy.
The job is almost done.
I never had the opportunity to use it.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Don't run risks.
I have hardly any money left.
I want to make a complaint.
You look surprised.
Jet planes fly much faster than propeller planes.
We have no secrets.
I was really surprised.
Horses are easily spooked.
We have nothing to be afraid of.
What train you are going to take?
I have seen her before.
My son wants to be a professional golfer.
I know you want to help.
I think I'm prepared for that.
It's time for bed.
Please handle it with the utmost care.
He is not always late.
I won't keep you too long.
He seems to be happy.
I didn't get the joke.
Tom is apparently a truck driver.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Tom helped the old lady cross the street.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
Thank you all very much.
Don't do that.
He weighed the stone in his hand.
Tell us a ghost story.
The 1990s began with the Gulf War.
I figured Tom would never find it.
They might be taller than you.
I forgot my key.
What if I asked you to stay?
He had an operation on his left leg.
Have a drink.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?
It took me more than a week to put the model ship together.
Are you sure they can do this?
She appears to have been rich.
You should have spoken more politely.
I never felt this way before I met you.
That's all I wanted to hear.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
When did you arrive in Boston?
What caused the war?
Hey, don't forget this.
This book contains a lot of photos.
You're alone, aren't you?
You are trusted by every one of us.
They're all thieves.
I figured something was up.
What was that noise?
It didn't hurt at all.
I'm only going to show you once.
Read after me all together.
I'll take care of my parents when they get old.
She is trying to lose weight.
Nowadays children do not play outdoors.
I have a date tomorrow night.
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
I think he's tired.
May I count on you to get me the job?
I like dogs very much.
I do not like tea, so I generally drink coffee for breakfast.
I like seafood.
He tried it again, but in vain.
My wife hates cats.
The yen is rising and the dollar is falling.
Turn down the radio.
My garden is small.
Don't look back.
I dream about you quite often.
I can't do this job without you.
That's all they had.
Anyone can make a speech here on Sundays.
Please add my name to the list.
They all thought Tom was crazy.
This building belongs to my family.
These products are selling like hot cakes.
Don't waste your time in a dead-end relationship.
I'm just waiting for a friend.
Keep oil away from the fire.
The bear was eating an apple.
That reminds me of something I heard yesterday.
I figured that might be the case.
Yes. We should be very careful.
This shouldn't take too long.
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer.
He tucked the napkin under his chin.
She was homesick.
The telephone doesn't work.
Would you like to have another beer?
Don't tempt me.
It is time you went to bed. Turn off the radio.
January is the first month of the calendar.
Can you wrap these neatly for me?
We're being blackmailed.
I wish I were as rich as Tom is.
She's a fox.
I have an urgent message from Tom.
I want you to lay back and relax.
Don't let her go out after dark.
You have some books.
Are you scared of me?
He was not able to join in the discussion.
Tom plucked the chicken.
His doctor advised him to give up smoking.
First of all, we have to finish the homework.
I'm not old.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Get me some water.
I don't drink much beer.
I'll come as soon as I can.
Here's the bill.
Have you called her yet?
We're almost like brothers.
It ain't like before, you know.
Can you do without an English dictionary?
Has Father come home yet?
We should work faster.
Where did you find that strange thing?
Might I ask your name and address?
The wedding will be held in a 17th century church.
Could you give me some advice?
I think it's time for me to confront that problem.
He put on the black coat.
Tom pulled the rope.
I want to become a singer.
What brand of dog food do you feed your dog?
You may not remember me, but I remember you.
Where is the mistake?
They're very busy.
What is this for?
Tom sang better than Mary did.
I will be in high school next April.
I believe Tom will be acquitted.
This is a recipe for disaster.
We went camping in August.
He's not my father.
Nearly one billion people around the globe lack access to clean, safe water.
Don't forget your water bottle.
Dinner is almost ready.
How much did they give you for your old car?
I could say nothing in my dad's presence.
Please write your contact address here.
Tom disagreed.
Say that again.
I beat him at chess.
You should see a doctor.
I'll remember you forever.
This is the final straw.
I am seeing Mary this afternoon.
When do you use it?
I love you for who you are.
We're not interested.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
Give me a break.
I have a long way to go.
I thought it was the right thing to do.
He and I walked together.
Are you mentally ill?
At the sound of my voice, my dog pricked up his ears.
You'll be hearing from us soon.
I'm being held hostage.
That would be a mistake.
What's my room number?
Let's not talk.
I bet you didn't see that coming.
Tom's family is powerful.
I'll try to find one.
He was punished for his crimes.
A fire broke out during that night.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Tom is angry with us.
It doesn't matter who says that, it's not true.
Stop treating me like a child.
Did I hurt you?
Did you really dance with Tom?
Tom worked all night.
She felt very bad that day.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
Drink it down.
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
He told me to meet him at his apartment.
I wish that I could have spent more time with my father before he died.
She began to like him right away.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
I'm not your friend.
Any one of us could do it.
He used pigeons in his experiment.
I admit, I'm not the tidiest person in the world.
One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead.
How did you know where I'd be?
Can you help me make a snowman?
Where can I buy one of those?
I think you know that's inappropriate.
Do it again!
His chances for making a great deal of money are excellent.
I bought it in a thrift store.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
Things are only going to get worse.
He acted the part of King Lear.
Rice gruel is easy to digest.
Dinner is almost ready.
I can't thank him enough.
I wrote it.
There's someone here to see you.
You're not as smart as me.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
This is where he lives.
I'll let you know later.
I think you're drunk.
You're tough.
Tom said that Mary was alone.
It's not the same thing.
How did you become involved in this project?
Everybody's crying.
We still have to look for the hook.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I am Korean.
You don't need to wrap it.
She ignored him until he became rich.
Do you know the man who's staring at you?
I loved watching you dance.
She did nothing but cry all the while.
I just want what everyone wants.
Where did you go for spring break?
All of them are different.
This file is encrypted.
You're obnoxious.
Did you find everything you want?
That's the car I told you about.
You caught me off-guard.
That's exactly what I expect.
I can't see a thing.
He drank a cup of coffee.
You're not very tidy.
She speaks Chinese.
Did you read the whole book?
Tom is worried about his children.
Am I hired?
He looked back over his shoulder.
That's not the only reason.
It's not possible.
I just can't remember.
Are you sure there's nothing else to drink?
She watched him draw a picture.
I'm losing weight.
I'll buy you a beer.
She has a rose in her hand.
He wants to reach a wider audience.
I don't like talking with Tom.
It is an endangered species.
I don't pretend to understand global warming.
Do you think I should go alone?
He always sings while taking a shower.
He has a car.
There isn't anyone in the room.
He has his own car.
Did anyone see you come in here?
She avoided answering my questions.
Try to sleep.
He went by bicycle.
Will you be going?
I beg your pardon.
He invited me to his house.
Tom couldn't answer the last question.
Have a safe trip.
I always pay the rent on time.
I can't repair the computer.
Our fighters averaged 430 missions a day.
There is no shame in being poor.
How did you get hurt?
Tom may not wait any longer.
I wonder what I should make for dinner.
Time is money.
Come here, all of you.
The train finally arrived.
You said you wanted a family.
Who has eaten all the cookies?
I can't judge distance.
In Washington, no one knew what to expect.
He studied military history.
I feel guilty about having told a lie.
You three are under arrest.
Tom talked to Mary yesterday.
She's as pretty as her sister.
I'm not that bad.
This is the best party I've been to all year.
I don't know how this works.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
I've gone and caught a cold.
I like to run.
I often stay up all night.
Tom is very kind to us.
I am new here.
How do you know where to go?
We don't live in Boston.
Mine is better than yours.
How did you come by this painting?
I just thought you might want to go skiing with us.
Can I sit here?
Clean it up.
I got dumped.
I met an old friend by chance in Kyoto.
You should get rid of these weeds.
If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
Studying how to communicate effectively is time well spent.
He seems kind.
How old were you when your father was killed?
I recovered.
If you're smart, you'll cash out while you're ahead.
I didn't have lunch today.
I'm sleepy!
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
Get Tom to help you.
He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't.
Was there a book on the desk?
Tom had to do it even though he didn't want to.
Keep it at a lower temperature.
I'm finished with you.
I used to be fat.
This is a doghouse that I made myself.
You'll find a job.
I meet him on occasion at the club.
Give us everything you have.
By the time he retires, my father will have worked for almost thirty years.
He is the baby of the family.
Could you hand me the remote?
I think she will succeed as a lawyer.
He was sentenced to death.
He lives near my house.
You are a good boy.
Did you hear my show last night?
He gave me a smile of recognition.
I do believe you.
It's not at all typical.
Tom isn't stupid.
What she said is wrong.
You're not alone anymore.
She dressed up for the party.
"Tom's crying." "I know."
He may become a baseball player.
The investment advice we used to give just doesn't apply anymore.
I love this game.
Why would I want to sue you?
He is a highly paid man.
I'm looking for a sweater.
It is raining worse than ever.
The brave fireman rescued a boy from the burning house.
Do you have any problems with that?
I only did it for your own good.
I have a better idea.
I'm very happy.
I know you recently retired.
It's missing.
I can't put up with all that noise.
Have you been to Boston?
What's the last thing you remember?
You can say whatever you want to.
I want you to go upstairs.
How did they do that?
I think this is delicious.
I don't like our new coach.
Are we leaving soon?
He is a recognized authority on the subject.
He is content with the simple life.
Tom is the spitting image of his father.
That boy is very clever.
We're not married.
By the way, have you heard from her since then?
It was careless of him to make such a mistake.
Autumn is almost here.
What were you hoping to see?
Autumn is my favorite season.
The whole class was quiet.
I just got married.
There's nothing there.
He said that he had met her a week before.
You don't look Japanese.
I think we should call the police.
We're better than they are.
She doesn't understand me, either.
I owe you one.
He is going to the concert.
I can't believe you did all this without any help.
I said he could go.
My dad gave up alcohol.
It's for you to decide.
Could you speak a little louder please?
I'm going to be a father.
You're too skinny.
Everyone's asleep.
I just do what I can do.
You're so pathetic.
The man answers the description.
I want to get out of here.
She's had a hard life.
Smoking is a bad habit.
They'll find us.
"Thank you, I'd love to have another piece of cake," said the shy young man.
Tom asked Mary to brew some coffee.
I've already paid you.
I couldn't stop myself from laughing.
What're you doing?
Everywhere you look you can see young couples kissing.
You're upset.
When is the ship due to arrive?
We'll always remember Tom.
I was kidnapped.
You can't cling to the past.
You nearly broke my jaw.
What's your job?
Some wounds time never heals.
I finally caught up with my friends.
I've never even had a girlfriend.
Tom doesn't eat meat.
It was the best party ever.
I made an appointment to see him at seven o'clock.
I ran home.
They were even more interested in his beautiful wife.
I want answers to my questions.
We have to obey the rules.
I will call you in an hour.
He dedicated his whole life to helping poor people.
This made me very sad.
He himself did it.
She wanted him to stay longer.
They say she's sick.
Does this look good on me?
You have no idea who that is, do you?
Everyone knows his name.
I expect to be back next Monday.
Tom waited for more than an hour.
I don't remember ever seeing you here before.
You must be in good physical condition.
There is cranberry juice in the fridge.
If I don't do it now, I never will.
I want to hear you play the piano.
I just want to rest.
He's about to leave.
Can you give us your point of view?
Do you mean you don't know what happened?
We're old friends.
I hope things will turn out well for you.
I think we could help each other.
I'm glad that makes you happy.
Have you met him already?
Tom was heartbroken when Mary passed away.
The airplane was flying above the clouds.
I had a hunch you would do that.
"Why don't you come?" "Because I don't want to."
She traveled around Japan.
Tom goes swimming every day.
I have no idea how he escaped.
I was really mad at Tom.
I realized I couldn't win.
That's reason enough.
We've got to find Tom.
He always wears blue shirts.
He is one of the greatest artists in Japan.
I don't even want to know who you are.
I'd like a cup of tea, please.
A woman's wardrobe isn't complete without a little black dress.
Your face is red.
The bus was empty except for one elderly woman.
All of the students have to wear the same uniform.
I couldn't walk.
To try to bring it back would be foolish.
I'll never forgive you.
Something smells good.
Bad weather upset our plans to go on a hike.
We ate sandwiches for breakfast.
What will become of me?
His policies were too progressive.
I can't take any more of this.
I came to see you.
Girls are crazy.
It's no use for him to try to find out the real reason.
I had some help painting the fence.
How could that happen?
French is a very interesting language.
Tom will probably never win.
Tom's heart suddenly began to beat faster.
Nothing will determine our success as a nation in the 21st century more than how well we educate our kids.
She ran as fast as she was able to.
The house is said to be haunted.
That's all that matters.
The old man has enough money.
We all have our flaws.
We saw the film and had dinner together.
Look up the phrase in your dictionary.
I will get the work done in a week.
I don't know anything about racing.
I want you to take this medicine.
I despise you.
I packed your suitcase for you.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
As soon as I got home, the telephone rang.
She visits the dentist on a regular basis, so she seldom gets toothaches.
I just want to make it home in one piece.
We used to do a lot of things together.
I helped my father yesterday.
About how much money do you need?
She realized that she had better tell the truth.
He is a teacher.
Take a wild guess.
You're courageous.
I hope not.
The city was soon occupied by the soldiers.
Heads I win, tails you lose.
He went aboard the plane.
I thought about all the times we used to play together as kids.
Tom showed me the way.
Do you have any idea who would do this kind of thing?
Tom turned off his headlights.
There's a lot of traffic today.
He lived in Ankara for six years.
Let me tell you how Tom and Mary met.
I've got it all sorted.
When am I supposed to do that?
Are you really going to let Tom do that?
Tom knew there wasn't much he could do about it.
They can't believe it.
Feeling chilly, I turned on the heater.
Today was a tough day.
What exactly do you plan to do?
He is a student at Harvard.
Go ahead and talk.
Let's ask the teacher.
I get along with everyone.
I love my home.
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
It's very hot today.
What do you have against those people?
I have an appointment to dine with him.
You all did good work.
I only did my duty.
Hang on a second.
The tea is hot.
There is no doubt that he was murdered.
What just happened?
My neighbor's son made fun of my daughter today at school.
Are you blackmailing me?
Your friends sound nice.
Go to bed.
If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave.
I don't know what that thing is.
Did you say something?
The old chair groaned under her weight.
Don't be ridiculous.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
Eventually, Tom found out what had happened.
My study is upstairs.
I want to visit Korea.
He's going to have a heart attack.
He's ready to go.
I said thanks.
You must study your whole life.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
When will we arrive in Tokyo?
Our town was bombed twice this week.
Did you see it?
She seemed uninterested.
I'd like to get medical insurance.
You will need a bodyguard.
Why were you so slow?
I think you did an excellent job.
I've never been to Istanbul.
This afternoon the weather is going to get worse.
I could not catch as many fish as I had expected.
By the way, how old are you?
Half of them are students.
Many people are skeptical.
I'm sure everything will be fine.
The train was almost an hour behind schedule today.
Do you want me to wait?
I am a foreigner.
It's a good question.
The game starts at two tomorrow afternoon.
She translated it word for word.
I didn't know what to say to him.
I was stupid.
Do you see me?
Could you do me a favor?
Tom was my first real boyfriend.
I'd like to say a few words by way of apology.
What do you like to eat most?
I'll fix your wagon.
Because of the bad weather, the plane's departure was delayed by two hours.
Here I come.
Move back a little.
Get rid of her.
No one's judging you.
I have a car.
I didn't quite catch the name of that designer.
Why are you out at this hour?
Doctors save lives.
Do it the way he tells you to.
He drank three bottles of beer.
I realize the effort you have put into this project and I really appreciate it.
I'll get you out of this horrible situation.
I brought a book.
He's really quick.
We played chess.
I warned him of the danger.
Our school library has many books.
You are beautiful.
I will pick you up around six.
Where's everybody?
What does your spouse like to do that you don't like to do?
The tour guide can speak three languages.
The military quashed the revolt within a matter of hours.
I can't stand it anymore.
Show me.
I will stop you.
The newborn chicks still have not opened their eyes.
I can't believe you're considering doing that.
You know it doesn't matter.
She was surprised that it was that late.
You can see the whole city from this hill.
I think this will do.
I grew up in a small town.
You should have known better.
Don't be cruel to animals.
He's too busy.
Everybody didn't go to bed.
I don't want to discuss it.
What are you trying to prove?
Do you know how many people died in yesterday's plane crash?
All four of the boys didn't have alibis.
His uncle died five years ago.
Can you solve the puzzle?
What did you just say?
You don't have to tell me this.
I fell into the pool.
They didn't want me to examine it.
A museum is a great place to find a date.
I would like to visit South Korea.
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.
Tom speaks two foreign languages.
What time did you get home?
Step inside.
I don't have my passport with me.
Are we all happy?
I'm not pressed for money.
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
I found it difficult to please her.
We're overreacting.
I will give this book to whoever wants it.
He is a promising young man.
Why not apply for that job?
Tom couldn't tell what the problem was.
I was tired today.
I often travel.
There's no logical reason for this.
There seem to be lots and lots of stars.
I can't help you if you don't trust me.
These windows aren't clean.
You aren't listening to what I'm saying.
They are singers.
I apologize for the delay in replying.
My whole body was one big bruise after the rugby game.
I still think Tom is hiding something.
Isn't that ours?
I'd like you to postpone your trip.
His eyes are blue.
I don't want to bother you.
We moved into this house last month, but we still haven't settled down.
What's the problem anyway?
Tom wasn't in his room.
Seeing is believing.
And who are you working for these days?
I bought shampoo and toothpaste.
I'll shoot.
Call me at six tomorrow morning.
How did you get hurt?
You're not very tidy.
He plays the guitar well.
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders.
He is a man who loves ceremonies.
Could you please not smoke in this room?
He had an unpleasant screechy voice.
Tom sold his car to Mary.
I have been to the airport to see him off.
You should be real proud of yourself.
We've installed several security cameras.
I really wish I could be there with you.
I think you can handle it.
It's natural for family members to help each other.
Have you told everyone where the meeting will be?
Did you have fun last night?
How old are the children?
He had words with his friend and then struck him.
It took me some time to persuade her.
She enjoys listening to classical music.
What do you think Tom's shoe size is?
Every time I read this book, I discover something new.
You think you're funny?
She has never been asked out on a date.
I also use this study for receiving guests.
Be careful not to say anything stupid.
The soldiers were ready to die for their country.
I think you should go.
School is not a waste of time.
Our success was due to his efforts.
They released Tom.
Tom wanted it.
This patient is suffering from hypoxia.
I never thought we'd end up like this.
I'm not going to do anything about it.
I can feel it.
I have a tight schedule.
Stand up straight.
Do you all feel that way?
We have finished lunch.
What do you learn at school?
Would you come here a moment?
There is a TV remote control under the couch.
Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him where I'd gone.
How much are we short?
She asked me to help her with the work.
Should I be worried?
He came here ten minutes ago.
They didn't see anything.
I like living here.
I think Tom did well.
What do you want now?
It's already eleven.
Please write down what I am going to say.
Tom wants to sleep on it.
She lives in the country.
This is the latest fashion.
I want to help, but I can't.
I want to show you something very special.
That's exactly how I feel.
I've been trying to get your attention.
Do I look busy to you?
He was naturally very angry.
We were too optimistic.
You don't have to lie.
Something's not right here.
Look at all these boxes.
I thought I recognized you.
I'm doing the dishes.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Your book is on the desk.
I'm waiting for a train.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
Be fair.
I ride my bike to work.
She tried to persuade him to buy her a pearl necklace.
If you don't hurry, you won't get there before dark.
This doesn't answer my question.
I'll make this up to you.
I have brown hair.
Won't you come to the party tomorrow?
That can't be good for anybody.
We must help each other.
He will soon be past playing with toys.
He went to New York as soon as he got the letter.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
She got what he said.
This is crazy.
He denied having taken part in the crime.
This is a hybrid.
Tom had no idea how rich Mary was.
You're considerate.
I have been wanting to ask you a question.
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
I will not help you.
After eight months, he eventually started dating girls again.
Please try again.
Sorry, I can't help you.
She's waiting for you at home.
You should try it on.
It snowed yesterday.
A frown may express anger or displeasure.
He loves soccer.
The water is hot.
Developing political awareness takes time.
Why don't you help us?
Hang on.
It is no use asking me for money.
They must be crazy to believe such nonsense.
You didn't get very far.
I think I would have heard gunshots if there had been any.
I guess I could give it a shot.
Let me write that down.
It is not easy to get rid of bad habits.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
She began to sing.
I'm sure that I'll miss her a lot.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
He always keeps his promises.
She choked him.
It's not safe to text while you drive.
There's no limit.
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
I have no wish to live in a large city.
You're sleepy.
I'm not going to eat this.
I got all tongue-tied when she spoke to me.
I have been writing letters all day long.
I told him what the problem was.
She advised him to see the dentist.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
You were hungry, weren't you?
Tom should have been eating more vegetables and not as much meat.
Language and culture can't be separated.
When will you return?
He kept his promise.
Those who know do not talk. Those who talk do not know.
I can't believe this has happened.
I know how this works.
I'm sorry for what I said. I was out of line.
I think that's up to you now.
Look at the evidence.
It's the next logical step.
You're resourceful.
They are both good.
I think it'd be great if you could come.
When do you use it?
This sure tastes good!
Tom opened a window.
Some people believe in ghosts.
I won't keep you too long.
As you make your bed, so you must lie in it.
Commit these words to memory.
Everybody should have a purpose.
I don't know his name.
Our visitors are sitting in the living room.
I figured it out by myself.
I fixed it.
I love reading in bed.
I had my purse and commuter ticket stolen while I was sleeping in the train.
Can I see this one?
Several animals escaped from the zoo.
This is our only hope.
I don't know about the others, but as for me, I'm for it.
Is it possible that you're wrong?
I talked to my friend in the FBI.
Choose your next words carefully.
I don't think Tom knows how to dance.
Please move to the rear of the bus.
I love the way you kiss.
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
I can't go in there.
I can never thank you enough.
We must go.
I figured that might be the case.
What is it this time?
I'll show you around the town.
I'm pretty busy.
It's not a secret anymore.
She lost sight of her friend in the huge crowd.
We're very close.
The Texans began to organize their own army.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come.
I told you not to call me on weekends.
I am going to a concert next week.
Is this typewriter yours?
He remained single all his life.
I wish I had more time to talk to her.
We're all devastated.
Tom says he can't ignore Mary's behavior any longer.
A big earthquake occurred in India yesterday.
I don't recall you saying anything about that.
He used to love her.
This school was founded in 1650.
We have a majority interest in the company.
Who's that cute redhead?
He is the son of a wealthy family.
Are you planning to stay?
Did you do your homework?
She has been to Paris.
I think Tom wants something to write on.
Draw me a sheep.
He shaves four times a week.
How far is it from here to your school?
He rolled over in his sleep.
I let it fall.
There are six apples in the box.
I can see it in your eyes.
You should have seen it!
Make it smaller.
I'd like to ask you to help me.
Snap out of it!
I've forgotten your address.
He was angry because of what she said.
Are you interested in Japanese music?
Boil some water.
You're still growing.
It could rain tonight.
I like good coffee.
Tom is leaving Kobe tomorrow morning.
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
He's not one of us.
I might not be at tonight's party.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
This house is registered in my name.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for your health.
Are you telling me that I can't go?
Why don't you want to go first?
Why don't you take a seat here?
He has lots of new ideas.
I don't remember it.
I can't find the right words.
Tom had money, a lot of it.
Since I was tired, I went to bed.
Tom doesn't know who Mary has decided to give her old guitar to.
I want you to come with us tonight.
Tom was impatient and restless.
All of us play the piano.
Tom didn't even say he was sorry.
Am I supposed to thank you?
I didn't register.
We left the door open.
I made dinner.
That could be a problem.
I don't know whose umbrella this is.
How do we upload photos to your website?
The soul is immortal.
I think it'll rain today.
She gave him all the money that she had.
I can't do anything.
You're very brave.
Thanks for your explanation.
Fight like men.
She sat next to him wishing she were somewhere else.
My mother has a driver's license, but she doesn't drive a car.
What do you do for fun?
Tom is very stubborn.
I just need a little time.
Tom is still in the bathroom.
You don't know where it is, do you?
That is what I want to know.
Never mind what happened.
There is no sense in your worrying about your health so much.
I don't believe that to be true.
Is there something there?
What should I look for?
I'm writing a song in French.
That's what I was hoping to hear.
Can you make it go any faster?
Tsunamis swept through rice fields and flooded the towns.
Were the windows closed?
We have left undone what we ought to have done.
May I help you?
Can you drive a stick shift?
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
Tom split up with Mary.
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but sand.
I think I hear them.
You're free to go.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lived across the street from him.
That's how he discovered the comet.
Am I under arrest?
Make certain where the emergency exit is before you go to bed at a hotel.
I am afraid of having trouble.
It was a relief.
I'll leave it up to you.
I ran as quickly as I could.
Who's here with you?
Please answer the phone.
Boy was I naive.
We can't find Tom.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
We talked.
This cloth feels like velvet.
Don't be sorry.
You're not the only Canadian here.
You're very curious.
Please refrain from pushing forward.
I missed the competition.
Would you like to take a recess?
Got it!
I'm very poor.
You're very funny.
Do you mind if I open the window and let the smoke out?
You can rely on his proven ability.
Would you be friends with me?
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
I agree with your proposal.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
I might be a few minutes late.
I'm okay.
The weather is good today.
What teams were playing?
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I'll keep your secret.
Take it easy!
How much do you remember?
I'm glad that makes you happy.
I can't do this job alone.
I've been debating whether I should mention it or not.
You'd better tell the truth.
The reason for this is plain.
What kind of music does Tom like?
Cats can see in the dark.
I want my key back.
Tom is famous, isn't he?
I don't think anyone thinks you're crazy.
He did it, and what was more surprising, he did it by himself.
They are watching.
I'm worried about my weight.
Stop by whenever you can.
Our inventory is very limited.
I didn't understand what was happening.
He talks as if he knew everything.
Don't come in my room without knocking.
I'm sure.
I'll give you this money.
How do you know it's real?
Will it rain today?
If you want to talk, talk.
It's dangerous to swim in this river.
What's the point of coming here?
Just do what you've got to do.
I've had the time of my life.
It is out of the question.
I want them alive.
The man ate bread.
I got it through my head that my parent's strict rules were for my own benefit.
He's more than likely to be late.
It was a very big room.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
She went out.
Just imitate what he does.
I think you should tell Tom you love him.
What a clever dog!
Let me do my job.
I meant you no harm.
They were scolded by the teacher.
He was very good at playing tennis.
Please heat the water.
Tom has stayed at my house several times.
I'm sorry, today is fully booked.
I care about all of you.
She was about to call him up when he walked in the door.
Why are you mean to me?
I know that you have issues with your mom.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
You're very timid.
Where are we going next?
I could swim faster when I was young.
I kept on reading.
No one is invulnerable.
You need to have breakfast.
May I ask a favor of you?
Is it hot?
Did you tell Tom what he needed to know?
He has been gaining weight.
Your threats don't scare me at all.
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye.
Excuse me, what is the name of this place?
I have to show you something.
It's 3:30.
I was happy there.
It was cheaper than I thought.
I never thought I'd get that lucky.
Why did you let Tom go?
You can't be sure of that.
Tom forgot his umbrella in his car.
It isn't what he says that annoys me but the way he says it.
I'll not be at home next Sunday.
I'm 99% sure.
Tom didn't get paid for it.
Tom watched his granddaughters dance.
Tom doesn't mince words.
Did I wake you?
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
I took it for granted that you were on our side.
It's an old pain.
The students made her life happy.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I owe you an explanation.
I'll peel an orange for you.
I understand how much you want to go to the party, but I can't let you go.
I had a really good time yesterday.
You should put your ideas in writing.
You're safe as long as you stay here.
I have a daughter in high school.
Don't let the cat out of the bag.
Do you know me?
I asked him to drive me home.
I don't feel that guilty.
What a loser!
Why wasn't Tom there?
You're the one that went crazy.
Do you fly frequently?
I had to see you again.
All you can do is trust one another.
I should be in charge.
I do what is required.
There used to be a bridge here.
That's my favorite chair.
Can I offer you guys a ride?
I know it's not true.
As I was reading, I became more interested.
He met an unexpected obstacle.
There's a park near my house.
It's no use arguing with him.
Could I talk to the two of you alone?
I spent all my money on stupid stuff.
Please enjoy yourself at the dance.
I need that as soon as possible.
I want an attorney.
Prices went up.
You don't need to prepare a formal speech.
That's Saturn.
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
That's what I want most right now.
How did you get out of your room?
The book is out of print.
It's too little, too late.
How many books do you possess?
It's an ambitious project.
I'm about the same age as you.
I want my money returned immediately.
I'd like some time alone, please.
Tom drove Mary to Boston.
The storm destroyed the whole town.
Do you feel any better?
I'll check in.
Everyone looked relieved.
He scares easily.
She advised me where to stay.
You probably don't want to talk to me.
You must go to school.
Today's meeting has been canceled.
Can I take that as a compliment?
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
I respect those who always do their best.
I am very glad to meet you today.
I love you just as you are.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
This is just stupid.
I don't have to talk to you.
I am hers and she is mine.
Visiting Tom was a good idea.
Is this your bike?
I thought you'd be different.
The meat has begun to rot.
Please sit down for a moment.
The two brothers are very much alike.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
There wasn't much traffic.
Don't be so choosy.
Can we hurry this up?
I'm the one responsible for the accident.
You were perfect.
She made me a cake.
I'm here to do what I can.
Could you please briefly introduce yourself?
Does anyone have any other questions?
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
I remember when I first saw you.
I'm the one who's going to die.
Tom filled out the form.
I never thought about that.
Having a full time job and raising two kids at the same time is hard.
There's something about Tom that I don't like.
Why did you come here?
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
She is two years old, but she can already count to 100.
Let's listen to this cassette.
Between us, he is a little foolish.
I hate hypocrites.
Why don't you slow down a little bit?
You're out of touch with reality.
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
Tom is voting.
Sit down, Tom.
I'd like to forget the whole thing ever happened.
I have so many ideas.
I like having breakfast with you.
What do you think of my idea?
I was impressed with what I saw.
Show it to him.
I like your frankness.
I am out of work.
These implements are in common use.
Someone stole my passport.
What do they do with all their leisure time?
Is this everything?
Why don't you leave him alone?
Half of the people in the office took a day off.
She pushed the door open.
Do I look dead to you?
I bought the same camera as you have.
We're in danger.
He was worn out when he got home.
They want you dead.
They did not keep their word.
She had the decency to apologize.
It's kind of hard.
Did I just say something stupid?
There's a problem with the plane's landing gear.
I'm addicted.
She tried to conceal the fact.
What did they expect?
They said you were fired.
AI stands for artificial intelligence.
He claimed to be an expert in finance.
You don't look happy.
I understand it all now.
I'm sure we can work this out.
He trimmed his beard for the wedding.
We were all shocked.
There must be a way to arrive at a diplomatic solution.
I couldn't take that chance.
I could do this all day.
All you have to do is study harder.
That work was done very quickly.
He is unpopular for some reason.
It was fabulous.
The buildings are small in comparison with the skyscrapers in New York.
English is not easy, but it is interesting.
He compared his car to the new model.
My father took out his wallet and gave me ten dollars.
It's an ambitious plan.
Please mail this letter on your next trip to the post office.
I should stop procrastinating.
I am glad to help you.
I thought you wanted to get out of here.
In judging his work, we must take his lack of experience into account.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
My parents made me go there.
You can get it at a bookstore.
I don't care what you think of me.
She's my older sister.
That's what I figured.
I bet you're busy.
Bring your brother with you.
He was not happy about it.
I bike to work.
That's not such a bad idea.
He is not interested in art at all.
Can I borrow this umbrella?
She served the family for twenty years.
The players on this team are all giants.
I'd be honored.
I'll call him.
There were too many of them.
Tom lives in a cave.
He can't speak English.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
Do you want me to sing?
Tom seems to know all that already.
They're not always right.
Tom was given a warm reception.
I would like to draw.
Some abstract art is difficult to understand.
Not all of them are present.
Tom and Mary sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
I can't explain what happened.
Can you pronounce these words?
The lock must be broken.
We left four days later.
The roast lamb is very good.
Don't talk about yourself like that.
I was too astonished to speak.
I've studied French, remember?
Strive to be happy.
Tom handed an envelope to Mary.
This is a picture of you.
You should mind your own business.
Is there someone with you?
I'm well.
This is my dictionary.
Now it's time to make amends.
You look perfect.
Do you have a red pencil?
Please give me a book.
I've never heard English spoken so quickly.
Toss the gun onto the table.
I know none of them.
You should be careful in choosing friends.
How many of you are going?
He likes air travel.
Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I'd like a cup of tea.
The new furniture came today.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
My father is proud of being tall and handsome.
An athlete must keep in good condition.
She helps us.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
Can you excuse me for a minute?
She does not smoke.
How did you get here?
Could I use the phone?
They were scolded by the teacher.
Where is the nearest supermarket?
I have no idea why he quit his job suddenly.
There was a lot of snow last year.
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
His wife is one of my friends.
You're the owners.
The hardest thing in life is knowing which bridges to cross and which bridges to burn.
I had only one drink.
Be prepared.
I want to see what happens.
Don't you get it?
We're fasting.
We wasted a lot of time looking for Tom.
Actually, I'm kind of busy.
You have to eat before you go.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
Did you have fun over the weekend?
The Greeks used to worship several gods.
We're going to be working late.
They arrived there before dawn.
I don't know how many more times I'll be able to do this.
He ordered them to release the prisoners.
May I use this pencil?
What makes you so sure that this won't happen again?
I was going to suggest the following possibility.
Tom wants desperately to believe that what Mary said is true.
I'm going to take my car.
I am paid weekly.
I live upstate.
What time did Tom eat?
I feel kind of frustrated.
And now you wish perhaps to learn on less familiar traps?
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
Tom only sleeps about five hours a night.
I'll keep your secret.
You've got to try this.
Please call before you come.
English is spoken in many countries around the world.
All your questions will be answered.
They're right behind me.
I would like a word with you.
I told you it didn't work.
They don't take care of that dog.
I'd rather die than leave.
I do not like to make mistakes.
Finally, I finished a painting.
Basset hounds are gentle dogs.
When will I get to Tokyo?
His dream came true.
I wish I had eaten something else.
Look at my new car.
I don't think I've ever done anything that would cause my parents to want to punish me.
I've been very busy since I returned from abroad.
Is bungee jumping frightening or fun?
I knew I had a tough job ahead.
Can you handle it?
I want to talk to you about this report.
How long will it take to get there?
"Does she play tennis?" "Yes, she does."
I think it'd be better if Tom didn't tell Mary about this.
He sent me a present.
How many times a day do you eat?
She told me that she had bigger fish to fry.
You may disagree with me.
What was in it for you?
Don't ever lie to me again.
Is this a duty-free shop?
They are gathering nuts.
Don't make me do this.
You're very astute.
You seem very nervous this morning.
Give the dog some water.
I'm very proud of my son.
Stop acting like a baby.
I'll never be as good as you.
She gave it her personal attention.
I've been meaning to get in touch.
She is a second year student.
He tried to choke him.
I can't believe you actually did something like that.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
He and I are pretty much the same build.
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.
Why don't we all run?
The weather report is bad.
I'm departing this evening.
I agree with you to a certain extent.
She sometimes has her mother cut her hair.
My folks used to tell me stories about that.
I was quite nervous.
Do I have your permission to do so?
I won't tell you why I did that.
He is as smart as any other boy in the class.
What you are is more important than what you have.
The end of the world is coming.
He left his keys in the car.
Birds usually wake up early in the morning.
You've been great.
We've run out of ammunition.
She took two weeks' leave and visited China.
Tom didn't look that happy.
Your sacrifice was not in vain.
Could I see you a minute, please?
I'm sorry I lost my temper.
She plays tennis very well.
It seems like there's no money left.
It's April first.
I've been all over the world.
You don't have to tell me this.
Tom moved here three months ago.
Excuse me for interrupting you.
He doesn't show his true feelings.
What kind of flowers do you like?
I go to the park.
Tom found me a French teacher.
Why did you come here today?
I don't know really.
Tom handed Mary a knife so she could peel the apples.
He did the best he could.
I thought a lot about what Tom said.
I don't feel like waiting any longer.
I stayed there until he had left.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
Do as he tells you.
How about sleeping at home?
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?
The story is full of holes.
Keep a cool head.
Have you put on sunscreen?
I don't have time now.
Mary looks like her mother.
Hold your horses, young man.
He never looked back.
This is a difficult problem to solve.
I'm in the same boat.
I didn't want my mom to know.
I don't want to leave Tom.
Tom is a doctor.
You have the right to free speech, but not the right to slander.
The exact opposite is true.
I thought I'd be safe here.
She wept with emotion.
That's our house.
She is terrible at cooking.
You can't handle it.
She lives in the same house her grandparents lived in.
All I ask is that you show up on time.
Fish, please.
I wasn't fired. I quit.
You don't really want this job, do you?
What you're doing makes me nervous.
Mistakes were made.
You'll be all right.
Let them take care of themselves.
She gave us a vague answer.
I'm not sure of anything.
I've caught a cold.
I am very pleased.
You're a hundred percent right.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
I get a three percent commission on anything I sell.
I need a haircut.
I had to give it a try.
This makes no sense.
That's all we can ask.
I think we have a problem here.
I don't feel like singing.
Tom admitted he had accepted a bribe.
But very soon, the battle would become fierce.
You don't have to buy water, do you?
We took turns driving the car.
Websites collect information about you.
This applies to your case as well.
She asked him if he knew my telephone number.
You leave me no choice.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Tom stepped on the rake.
I made my son a new suit.
I've never seen a more god-forsaken stretch of desert.
You have to go to the party.
I spoke with her for one hour.
I've been worried all along.
Maybe we should start.
I haven't seen you for a while.
You're not the only one that was hurt.
Please book me a room in a first-class hotel.
I ordered pizza.
You don't look that good.
Where were they sent?
I plan to go to her cocktail party.
Find me a glass.
When did that happen?
You aren't wrong.
We were outnumbered.
I don't want you to wake him up.
He seldom, if ever, goes to church.
We have to do better.
Tom is hiding somewhere.
The clock says two.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
I used to dream about being able to breathe underwater.
Tom has just finished writing a letter to Mary.
What's with all the questions?
I was upstairs.
Try to calm down.
The company's stock price jumped yesterday.
I had expected him at the meeting.
You're resilient.
Tom'll pay.
My father often falls asleep while watching TV.
After the hatchet job my boss did on my proposal, I'm not sure how long I want to keep on working here.
I don't recall saying that.
I telephoned her at once.
Where did you find it, at school or at home?
Which cup will he choose?
You can go there.
Have you seen anyone else?
I'm not giving up yet.
Where is the Red Cross?
I'm calm.
The boats collided head on.
You'd better go home as soon as possible.
Can you help me write a love letter?
Did you have a nice evening?
You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone.
She writes to her son from time to time.
We spoke briefly.
I like all of them.
Wait a bit longer.
These paintings are beautiful.
She advised him to give up smoking, but he wouldn't listen to her.
This winter will probably be very cold.
I wish I were young.
Osaka is the second largest city of Japan.
I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.
The museum is not open on Monday.
You won't be the only one there.
Are you sure it was Tom?
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to lock the door.
Roll down your window.
Why are you flinching?
Do you think I'm stupid?
Open your mouth.
Try to find out if everything he said is true.
I got really hungry.
That's exactly what he wanted.
What time's your flight?
I had to make a choice.
The food didn't taste very good.
I met a friend of mine at the airport.
What's your opinion on this?
Tom and Mary went to a fancy restaurant to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Tom is downstairs.
The surgeon who operated on Tom is very experienced and highly regarded.
He lied to my face.
Don't tell anyone.
He was humiliated by her.
We can't turn back now.
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
He saluted the lady.
I was defenseless.
I put my hand on his shoulder.
You decide.
Short skirts have already gone out of fashion.
We're not dating.
He left Japan at the end of the year.
It's not how much you know, but what you can do that counts.
It's cold today.
I thought we could talk.
Tom won't be in time for the meeting.
Most boys know his name.
People are not always what they seem.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
She told me an interesting story.
Hope to see you again next year.
I took the wheels off my bicycle.
We complained that the room was cold.
I wish I had known how to do it.
Do you want to watch this movie again?
I would like to see the festival.
It wasn't me. It was Tom.
I thought we were going to win.
Did you have a good summer?
The class was too big so we split up into two smaller groups.
I wash my hair every day.
That problem naturally invited discussion.
Don't be crazy.
They treat their employees well.
What's your favorite color for carpets?
Is there something we can do?
Nothing ever makes him angry.
I think Tom would've stayed longer if he could've.
She really hates this way of thinking.
Looters stole ancient artifacts from the tomb.
This stays between you and me.
Are you students?
It was pretty frightening.
Saddam rejected the demand.
He was not impressed.
He succeeded in solving the problem.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
That's a big one.
You'll ruin everything.
Kids can be so mean.
Have you brought your ID card with you?
No one will know.
I ordered a book from London.
Let's sit down somewhere.
He shooed the flies away.
I like to be thorough.
I didn't realize you were so good at French.
I'm at home.
I belong to the sailing club.
Why is this website taking so long to load?
Whatever happened to your pride?
Money is not a criterion of success.
I'd like to thank everyone who helped.
Don't you remember what you said?
We decided to lie hidden for a few days.
Ancient customs are dying out quickly today.
You will need a key.
I can't collect my thoughts.

I'm waiting for the light to change.
At last, she was able to contact her old friend.
It is important to understand that each country has its own culture.
You were told to stay on the ship.
I'm pretty busy.
I thought you were older than me.
You are a good person.
That's the way I like it.
Did Tom eat?
I want to make a complaint.
I'm not ready to fight.
I appreciate all you've done.
Our apartment is starting to look pretty cool.
I arrived too late.
Well done!
He is getting better bit by bit.
Can you believe it?
Do you drink wine?
Didn't you lock up your car?
Will you please explain the meaning of this sentence to me?
She became pregnant.
My car is parked not far from here.
You don't have to get up so early.
How could you not know?
How can you be so sure of that?
We'll shoot.
I can't think of everything.
You can't imagine doing that, can you?
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
Bad weather kept us from going out.
I know that better than anybody.
Take two aspirins for your headache.
I'm worried about it.
I don't know what that meant.
He is twice as old as she is.
I bought a backpack at the army surplus store.
It was deliberate.
Many great thinkers who were unknown while alive became famous after death.
Tom is a correctional officer.
Most of my friends are guys.
Do you know who that tall blonde girl in green is?
What are your duties?
The noise kept me awake all night.
He came by bus.
I don't follow.
That's ridiculous!
He had called the rebels traitors.
He got down on his knees and prayed for the souls of the deceased.
We don't forget.
How do you deal with it?
We're deluding ourselves.
I paid my bills.
His knowledge of geography is insufficient.
You don't look that good.
I can't find the address of my hotel.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
Tom stepped off the train.
It was his fault.
Be there tonight.
It was a massacre.

He knows nothing about politics.
What's your favorite racing game?
Everyone jumped into the pool.
We're not open.
He ogled a girl outside a pub.
You must continue to train.
Finally, he reached his goal.
Let me explain.
I suggest we swim across the river.
The cheesecake tasted too sweet.
This room is comfortable.
Look at all these flowers.
It's complex.
There wasn't any special hurry.
Did you pick up on that strange tone in his voice?
I must finish my homework before dinner.
Are you sure you can handle this?
She is hard at work.
He had a queer expression on his face.
When he reached the station, the train had already left almost half an hour before.
They strolled along the beach.
There must be some kind of problem.
I caused an accident.
I heard a Japanese nightingale.
Give me your address.
Is this a coincidence?
We now know that was a lie.
Tom can do better.
I write every chance I get.
By the way, what's your address?
You are welcome to do anything you like.
So what is it you want me to do?
There is something I must know.
Did you sleep well?
It's great to meet you.
My radio is broken.
Each of the three boys got a prize.
I never see a library without wishing I had time to go there and stay till I had read everything in it.
In a crisis, you must get in touch with your teacher.
The baby kept quiet.
He felt his heart beating fast.
Raise up your left hand.
I'd forgotten that.
If you want one, you'll have to find your own.
If only I'd been a little more careful!
It's a beautiful day!
He came at me with a knife in his hand.
I don't kiss and tell.
I'm a stranger here.
I followed the rules.
Please turn the television on.
You should go home.
I have many model cars.
Please tell me it's crazy.
I'm patient.
I still have a lot of pages to read.
He stopped reading the newspaper.
Let's not argue.
We've got plenty of time.
We were struck dumb with astonishment.
We're not welcome.
Did I give you enough time?
I don't care what you do with your money.
The door is closing.
Don't lie to me.
Don't use your real name.
You've been there before, haven't you?
I still don't like it.
We only have enough food and water for three days.
Hello, how's business?
I'd like you to wear this.
Tom often contradicts himself.
I want to be a hero.
Do you remember what to do?
That's a pretty dress you have on.
I'm drinking orange juice.
Why didn't you say something earlier?
You're not a city girl, are you?
Get up at once, or you will miss the 7:00 bus.
Do you have a coin?
The windows are open.
You said that you loved Tom.
Tom and Mary were always fighting.
All of the dogs were alive.
Come early so we can discuss the plans.
The new server should have much better performance.
She showed me her new car.
I can't help feeling something's wrong.
Why don't you mind your own business?
It's a very good newspaper, isn't it?
I don't know how deep the lake is.
This was your idea.
I'm on holiday.
Tom accepted the job.
"May I go with you?" "Of course."
Are we prepared?
Don't move.
I'm sick of your complaints.
Everyone kept talking.
Tom always keeps a set of jumper cables in the trunk of his car.
It was my turn to straighten up the room.
You're not that interesting.
Is it hot over there?
You don't have to come.
I don't have time now.
It seems to me that something is wrong.
I have a ranch.
A contract with that company is worth next to nothing.
I'm sure Tom did his best.
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
I just wanted to write songs.
You're such an idiot!
You're very forward.
That's incredibly boring.
Our house is yours.
She knit him a sweater for his birthday.
How are you getting along in your new job?
What do you think I did?
I am in no position to do anything about it.
It may occur at any moment.
This changes nothing.
I can run as fast as Tom.
The work has already begun.
I knew my time would come.
I suppose it's possible.
The owners appointed him manager.
I will give it a try.
Who will you give the book to?
Aren't you afraid of anything?
It's all downhill from here.
I'll be ready next time.
When does it open?
Tie your shoes.
What kind of information are you looking for?
If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.
That's hard.
What scared you?
Let me see what's in your hand.
This is a very low-stress job.
Where's the nearest museum?
Tell me which one to choose.
I really want to believe you.
A sneeze leaves your body at forty miles an hour.
I owe you a big one for getting me out of the jam.
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
I've never noticed that.
I've never been able to talk to Tom.
Some young Japanese people prefer being single to being married.
I'm always happy.
I ran into my friend.
Don't give in to peer pressure.
This is the last game.
What does it cost to build a new house in this neighborhood?
Say goodbye to your friends.
My idea is different from yours.
Take a look.
I'm a bit busy.
Beat the eggs.
We've got nothing in common.
No one says that.
I will speak to you tomorrow.
You seem to be in such a nasty mood today.
Not everyone agrees with you.
I earn my living as best I can.
I'm not sure what he was thinking.
She painted the walls white.
I don't think Tom can do that.
I felt a little dizzy.
I wouldn't want anyone to see us.
Can you hurry up?
A number of countries have strict laws against drugs.
They can't start without me.
He earns his living by teaching.
Are you absolutely sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
He became furious.
The same holds true for Germany.
I think we can do a lot better.
They were soldiers.
I thought you wouldn't give up.
I'm worth more than this.
He is mentally handicapped.
I want you to read this letter.
He and I have a near-telepathic understanding of each other. No sooner does one of us say something than the other is already responding.
Could you drop me off?
I have a friend at City Hall.
A cold wind was blowing.
What time did you get home?
There's a risk.
You must be in love.
Can you direct me to the nearest subway station?
The cat is not dead.
We've chosen a hotel near the museums.
We'll do it tomorrow.
Isn't it black?
Meiji was beaten by Keio by a score of three to five.
I'm sorry.
I haven't had the honor of meeting him.
We ran after the thief.
I feel nauseous.
I owe him my life.
Aren't you hot?
I think you're in danger.
Never tell anyone.
That has to be a misprint.
She means nothing to him.
I am not getting involved.
He apologized profusely.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
We're going to go into the other room.
All my problems are over.
It's not irrelevant.
I know that you love Tom.
Where can I find a hospital?
I have nothing to do with that case.
I could've met you at the airport.
Tom is driving too fast.
He collected a lot of stamps.
Can you go faster?
We're trying to close the box.
I know where you hide your diary.
There are a few boats on the lake.
Additional imports of American beef are planned to meet rising demand.
Tom needs to know the truth.
I don't want to listen to you.
Tom isn't worried.
I knew all along that Tom wasn't telling the truth.
Tom would've made the same decision I'm making if he were in my shoes.
I ordered a book from London.
Tom walked out of the meeting.
I left it on the table.
A new oil tanker was launched.
You look smart.
I appreciate your concern.
He couldn't help himself.
I really need to talk to you.
You can always count on Tom.
I shouldn't have to ever come back here.
I used to go ice fishing when I was younger.
How can it be?
You can't swim here.
You are good.
I have no books to read.
What happened to the dog?
Should I go or would you like me to stay?
It wouldn't take all that long to explain.
The word "theory" is often misused.
They say this old house is haunted.
I'd like to know what it is.
What do you think might be causing the problem?
We knelt down to pray.
They are arguing.
I can't find my wallet.
Is it necessary for me to explain the reason to him?
I don't expect to be gone long.
We're out of ammo.
The castle is now in ruins.
About how many books do you have?
Without your help, I would have failed.
Tom wasn't amused.
You cannot prevent him from drinking.
You made my day.
I don't like feeling helpless.
Are you ready for Christmas?
I think that's better.
I wish I could be more spontaneous.
It's not a suitable topic for discussion.
I'll cook it, if you eat it.
I'm immune.
Somebody came to see me while I was out.
We were very close.
They're students.
The thermometer is an instrument for measuring temperature.
No one's watching me.
We're going west.
There's always hope.
I calculated that it would cost 300 dollars.
How did you get so strong?
I'm sort of an extrovert.
This was part of the plan.
Your hand is as cold as ice.
You don't know what you're talking about.
How could you not tell me about this?
We're not going to make a decision overnight.
That guy is a crook.
I sell flowers.
I don't like your name.
She spends time with her grandmother every Sunday.
They glanced at each other.
We don't have a lot of trouble.
Wait a sec.
Would it be ethical to sacrifice one person to save many?
Tom threatened Mary.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
I love this one.
He's bulked up quite a bit since he's been going to the gym.
You look so handsome.
You may swim.
Am I going to die?
We got there at the same time.
I was too stunned to talk.
You are good.
Tom did his best to avoid making eye contact with Mary.
Have you read that book?
That looks like it would be fun to do.
Do you think anyone can see me?
This is a very rare specimen.
He is leaving for New York next week.
It is he who is to blame.
We are sorry for the interruption.
I can eat anything but onions.
Take as much time as you want.
She appealed to me for help.
She will return within an hour.
Stories often have happy endings.
You should be able to do this by yourself.
You're very rude.
It may possibly be fine tomorrow.
I believe in you.
I have an interest in Oriental ceramics.
I really like him.
Are you looking for a job?
We need more doctors like you.
When will his new novel be published?
I don't know how to thank you.
He died yesterday.
Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The farmer sowed his field with wheat.
He was elected mayor again.
I was absent from school yesterday.
Tom draws well.
You must not tell a lie.
Are you sure that's necessary?
Please do something about it.
You're disobeying orders.
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
Is there something wrong with me?
Tom wanted to know where it happened.
I saw you yesterday.
Classes begin at 8 o'clock.
I don't usually burn incense at home.
I can't hear you well.
We're claustrophobic.
I'm not busy.
He caught me by the neck.
Let's not go.
What a nice car you have! You must have paid a lot for it.
Would you like to visit the White House someday?
There's nothing more to say.
I'll lend you the tools that you need to do that.
Kennedy Airport, please.
I can jump.
I knew you could do it.
They're sunbathing around the pool.
You're very efficient.
What do you remember?
Hurry up, girls.
He said, "I want to be a scientist."
It seems that they took the wrong train.
What are you writing?
We had nice weather yesterday.
Your garden needs some attention.
I can't go to the police.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Do you like Moscow?
Why were you fired?
You underestimate your importance.
He has a good memory.
I can't permit this to continue.
She told me she loved me.
I promised myself I wouldn't do this again.
Why are you asking this?
You can stay at my place.
Where are our umbrellas?
We won't be judged.
I want to know where it is.
I don't want you to be upset.
They wanted protection.
Above all things, we must not be selfish.
I didn't know you still had friends at the IRS.
I cannot put up with this noise.
I'm going through my closet to find clothes to give to charity.
You must have lost them.
Where did I put the hammer?
He handed the letter to the secretary.
I didn't know that.
Tom is biting his nails.
You're very attractive.
I eat meat almost every day.
They gave him both material and spiritual support.
Let's not get carried away.
They want you dead.
I married off my daughter.
The mayor didn't like what the journalists wrote.
He lives by himself.
Would you like me to go there with you?
Don't believe what he says.
You're very forward.
Don't speak to him like that.
I left my hat on the plane.
I'm sure Tom was involved.
Why does Tom want to hurt me?
What is it you want to tell us?
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
I need you to go home.
I'll leave Tom alone.
Do you want to look at it?
She's five years younger than I am.
Why was Tom fired?
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
I thought you wouldn't like it.
Tom is a psychologist.
That was quite a speech.
Kissing Tom was a mistake.
Strong winds accompanied the rain.
I do anything I feel like.
He never travels without taking an alarm clock with him.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
Tom certainly gets a nice sound out of that old bassoon.
This is accurate.
Don't bother.
I can't help doing that.
Please don't laugh at me.
He kept me waiting for an hour.
Your house is very nice.
I had an awful day.
You keep out of this.
She was barred from the club.
I didn't want to bug you.
We should go to sleep.
I think Tom would like that.
There is one less.
I'm not like that.
Try not to worry.
I was saved as if by a miracle.
You don't have to go unless you want to.
He will get well very soon.
Don't make me shoot you.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
Do you mind if I go?
We need to water the flowers.
Get a job.
Are you ready?
We finally struck a bargain.
I must say I'm a bit disappointed.
It sounded easy.
I don't think Tom wants to see me.
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
Some of them are teachers.
We didn't do a thing.
His voice carries very well.
We left home early in the morning.
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some.
I was crushed.
Many parents think there's too much violence on television.
Your dinner is getting cold.
Say which you would like.
I saw something.
Do you mind if I turn down the TV?
Can I see you a second?
Tell me where you went.
Chivalry isn't dead.
This directly concerns Tom.
I support you one hundred percent.
Can you remember his name?
I'll get in touch with you again about this matter.
Are they cops?
I'm not going.
Never tell a lie.
It is sad that so few people give money to help the hungry.
He was right the first time.
He was wounded in the war.
Italy isn't Greece.
I want to share this with you.
I only wish that were possible.
He is always giving presents to his wife.
I had a vision.
Are you sure you don't want to do this?
Spring has come.
I came upon an old friend of mine on the train.
I can't believe it either.
When was the last time you saw the cat?
I met his sister last week.
Human beings, whether they realise it or not, continually seek happiness.
He leaned over her and said, "No, I'm not lying."
I don't know if I can stay.
It is necessary for you to go and encourage the girl.
Did you vote?
We can handle that.
Did you get it?
That dog runs very fast.
See to it that this problem gets fixed by tomorrow.
Tom called Mary every day.
Did anybody take notes?
We'd better go home now.
I have enough money to buy it.
We must act.
Tell me what you want.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
Tom and Mary were both alcoholics.
You can't know that for sure.
French is an interesting language.
That made me very sad.
I'm checking options.
I think that was the plan.
I really like you a lot.
He couldn't understand the sentence.
Don't back away.
You're hurting him.
I wrote this song just for you.
She promised to meet him last night, but she never showed up.
Christmas is soon, isn't it?
I admire him for his courage.
I think something is wrong.
Everybody started cheering.
I tore my jacket on a nail.
I just don't want to lose you.
I will sue you.
He's so young.
That sword is fit for a prince.
You're the one that went crazy.
I'm going to a monster truck rally.
The old houses were torn down to make room for a supermarket.
We'll miss living in Boston.
Tom glanced at the others.
I thought you might want to know.
Are you listening to him?
Stand aside.
Are your hands clean?
This message is for Tom.
Tom understands.
Can you loan me a pen?
Tom didn't go to the lake last summer.
There's been a misunderstanding.
I really like being with you.
Everybody panicked.
Quickly buy all required items.
We were caught in a shower while we were on a picnic.
What time is sunrise?
I'm not going.
She told me that she loved me.
He hasn't read the book yet.
I was asleep.
I need to get some sleep.
I do not mind what you do.
Unfortunately, it's raining today.
This is good meat.
I'll write you as soon as I arrive there.
I hope you two are happy.
My father may be sleeping.
Where do you live now?
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
Where is the Chinese embassy?
He has overstepped his authority.
How is the weather?
What should I do to save time?
We've achieved a lot in the past three years.
I did nothing wrong.
I sat down and opened my notebook.
Tom is at Mary's home.
What a pain!
It wasn't all my fault.
He is reading a book.
I would complain.
I said exactly what they wanted to hear.
I shouldn't have used the word "password" as my password.
Do you realize what you're doing?
I went to school.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
She is much taller than me.
Tom is playing the violin now.
You're the only person I know besides me who likes to do that.
His daughter, as well as his son, was famous.
I don't mind at all.
We are going to the shop.
He stretched out his arm for a magazine.
Tom was never happy.
I was celebrating.
Get out while you can.
You control your destiny.
You have to be careful.
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
They're staying.
I can't wait till summer.
You are responsible for this accident.
I'd like to believe that.
Can you unclog the toilet?
Whose glasses are these?
Why don't you take the day off?
Tom's car caught fire.
May I ask you to do me a favor?
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
I owe you a beer.
I'll give you a piece of advice.
As far as I know, that never happened.
No one will believe me.
She lit the candles.
I can't hear it.
How do you account for that?
Would you have time to help me with something?
That's all there was.
That's possible.
I didn't want Tom to get in trouble.
What's your real name?
I like studying wild flowers.
I just wanted Mary to love me.
I outrank you.
I held his sleeve.
You could be one of them.
Study hard.
He waited for him until 10.
That would be a good idea.
I am not frightened of anything.
I am at home every evening.
Will you show me your photo album?
They caught a lion alive.
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?
I didn't realize the difference between them.
Let's not pretend otherwise.
Greed is not always good.
The older we grow, the less innocent we become.
I'm considering resigning.
I'm giving it back.
You need to be prepared.
She can hardly speak.
You warned me, but I didn't listen.
Why don't you run for student council?
The houses are burning.
My stomach hurts.
What else do we need?
I appreciate your telling me.
Nothing is more important than health.
Drinks are on me.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
How did you end up being Tom's manager?
Snow fell early this winter.
The dictionary on the desk is mine.
Twelve people have walked on the moon.
The suspect was innocent of the crime.
The teacher was disappointed at my answer.
Did you read it all?
Don't use this faucet.
Will you please show me the way?
We were studying all afternoon.
I want you to find out.
How's your morning been?
Are you studying chemistry?
You want something from me, don't you?
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
I needed the money.
I'm used to Tom always yelling at me.
I never thought it would happen.
He got caught.
These cars are ours.
We don't care what he does.
I'm glad you could make it.
Tom showed Mary's letter to me.
He has three older sisters.
I am not about to pay ten dollars.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
I had a bad dream last night.
Might I ask your name?
They will agree on that.
Tom has no idea what that means.
It's not as bad as it sounds.
Come on, wake up.
Tom thought Mary was probably about thirty.
I'd like to know what's going on.
I cannot quite understand it.
May I open a can?
He is never lazy.
I can't believe you did all this without any help.
I want to find someplace quiet to study.
I am in the habit of going for a walk before breakfast.
Neither is correct.
Don't try this at home.
I'm still waiting for your answer.
I let you catch me.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
I'll be free.
I can't make myself understood in German.
I want you to help me get out of here.
At last, my turn came.
One thing I've always wanted to do is go camping with my family.
You're not alone.
I have to be honest. I was a little bit nervous the first time I had an MRI scan.
I never leave on vacation without first cleaning my apartment.
It's raining cats and dogs.
What did you do with my luggage?
I hope the weather will be fine tomorrow.
Practice what you preach.
I'll get there before you will.
The stable is right behind the farm house.
What do you say to taking a rest?
Did you finish your paper?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I feel so bad.
He has something to do with the matter.
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was in the haunted house.
They have already finished the work.
I didn't want to give up.
Best of luck to you.
Did you enjoy the movie you saw last night?
Stop chattering and finish your work.
Do we have a babysitter for tonight?
I need another one.
He's not available.
How did you come by all this money?
Most Hollywood movies have a happy ending.
Whatever you do, don't push that button.
Why don't you come over and eat with us this evening?
You're very good.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Is she coming, too?
Would you like more mashed potatoes?
Tom left home a few minutes ago.
"Who will be coming to the party?" "A few friends and four or five colleagues."
Mom, could you read me a bedtime story?
What exactly is it that you want me to say?
Sit down!
Tom will always remember you.
Tom is really busy, isn't he?
She wriggled her toes.
Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it.
Who is your favorite player?
I dropped my earring.
Nobody deserves that.
I've got someplace I need to be.
You never asked what I wanted.
I hate this song.
I don't like this camera.
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
Do you want me to lose my job?
Mr. Jackson gives us a lot of homework every day.
You'd better back off.
It's almost six.
All of a sudden, the barn went up in flames.
Going out drinking with the guys makes him feel macho.
I'm ugly.
I think it's time for me to walk away from this mess.
This book hasn't yet been translated into French.
The accident resulted from his carelessness.
Keep this lesson in mind.
I forgot to send you an e-mail.
Tom didn't get off the airplane with the rest of the passengers.
Turn everything off.
Do you have the same thing in a different color?
I think you should go now.
You don't have to go with Tom.
Don't swear in public.
Where are Tom's keys?
Have you ever kissed a girl?
Why don't you tell me why you think it happened?
Look in the phone book.
You're callous.
There's a cure for everything, except death.
Boston is a big city.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Japan has caught up with America in some fields.
Tom never gets invited to parties.
You're all hypocritical.
Nobody cares how much the dinner is going to cost.
She was laughed at by her friends.
We need to go.
Do you like cooking?
I'm used to this cold weather.
Don't call me.
"Thanks." "You're welcome."
You don't need to wait.
All the kids at school made fun of me because I was fat.
We're conscientious.
I am not sure yet if I will go to a university or get a job.
Almost no one believed him.
I'm not hungry at all.
How about a beer?
They are about to start.
Please take me home.
Take me to your place.
Don't rush.
Have a good weekend.
Tom doesn't know the whole story.
These boxes are made out of plastic.
You put in too much pepper.
You'll have to stand on your toes to see.
He is a good match for me in tennis.
Why did you stop?
Tom found something.
I'm sleepy, so I am leaving now.
She whipped out her pistol.
They are bored.
I am a man who can't stand being alone.
My sister's getting married.
I'm not saying his music is bad.
You're no different.
How many times a year do you go skiing?
Don't litter!
Tom asked me where he should park.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom is the fastest runner on our team.
There were no more free seats.
We discussed what to do.
I never told you to quit.
I don't know what you're looking for.
I guess not.
What she said made him angry.
People once believed the world was flat.
I wasn't scared at all.
I've always wanted to try it.
Tom couldn't get his shoes off.
It's a matter of pride.
Did you read the article?
I wasn't aware that someone was watching me.
Are you ready to go?
Tom will buy a new car next weekend.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
I thought I had a day off.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
Talk to me!
It was too late.
Tom lives on the floor above me.
He's going bald.
I remember seeing you last year.
Today's show is a rerun.
Tom explained the decision.
It's right in front of your eyes.
The treaty did not ban nuclear tests under the ground.
About how many English words do you know?
We're quite alone.
Is there anything that I can do for you?
Get your hands off me.
You're crafty.
I can't allow you to do that.
I'll work.
You're very wise.
I needed to meet you.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
Her hobby is collecting stamps.
I had nothing to do with that.
You have not seen it.
Which book do you need?
Is there a zoo in Boston?
He hammered at the window.
There was a heavy rain yesterday.
Push the red button if something strange happens.
Someday you should give it a try.
He looked back at us many times and walked away.
I've never seen my cat act like that.
He suggested that we take a short rest.
Don't worry about things that aren't important.
Tom doesn't usually show his feelings.
I just can't believe they're getting married.
He is Italian by birth.
He cleared the roof of snow.
We managed to get there on time.
He used a lot of honey.
I had to do my duty.
I'll tell Tom to stay outside.
Business is very good now.
I know a little Spanish.
I remember being on a ship when I was only five years old.
It's your only chance.
Did anyone else feel that?
Don't lie. Tell the truth.
I don't know who you're talking about.
If you had a time machine, which year would you visit?
This is going to be fabulous.
I don't know which of you came first.
"When does your sister come back from work?" "I don't know, but I think she'll arrive at home a few minutes before me."
Sorry, something went wrong.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
It's not a pyramid scheme.
Do you know what the difference is?
Tom could've been seriously injured.
Do you understand the difficulty of my job?
That is very expensive!
It's pretty hot.
Tom could help you.
It's a fairly complicated problem.
Stop flirting with my sister.
He lacks judgement.
Did you like it?
I knew the risk.
Where would you like to live?
You aren't supposed to swim here.
They are not at all interested.
The ball rolled across the road.
He lives far away from my house.
It shouldn't be like that.
After a while, corn flakes in milk will become soggy.
Study these sentences.
I never loved you.
Tom is an air traffic controller.
How do you think I can convince her to spend more time with me?
Be careful!
I'll see what I can do, but no promises.
They are still children.
It's not clear when he came here.
I came here to give you a gift.
I know what Tom likes to eat.
What are your intentions?
His bag is right here, so he cannot have gone to school yet.
This looks good.
You may change your mind.
You know what they say.
Can you show me where I am on this map?
He also speaks French.
Could you show me this bag?
The sisters are quite alike.
Why don't you want to wear a dress?
Shut up. If you don't, you'll be thrown out.
He arrived after the bell rang.
You can't change Tom.
I finished the work yesterday.
The mountain is covered with snow.
It's a rental.
She is always trying to please him.
It was really overpriced.
I'm not busy right now.
You're very angry.
Go home quickly.
A child is crying somewhere.
We're all cowards.
How big you are!
If you're hungry, then eat.
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I appreciate your vigilance.
I'm not going to stop working.
Make him work for it.
What're you talking about?
There is little hope of success.
Do as you want.
It is true that she is pretty, but she is selfish.
She called for help.
You should try the exam again.
One of the best ways to help us is to translate from a foreign language you know into your own native language or strongest language.
Our class consists of 40 boys.
Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
Tom and Mary are giving a party on Friday night.
Taiwanese food is milder than Indian food.
She panicked when she heard the news.
We're not related.
I just want you to think about that.
Where did you get this key?
I don't know what I was thinking.
I know what it's like to be poor.
I've no idea.
This is the American Embassy.
It's hard for me to express ideas through words.
She was engaged as an interpreter.
He went shopping.
It's an older model.
A fire broke out during the night.
He's known for that.
This isn't my problem.
The room was warm.
You can't go yet.
I used to live near a park.
Smoking is prohibited.
That would be fine.
I won't tolerate that.
You're not very funny.
He'll lend you his book.
I couldn't remember the title of that song.
Tom and Mary have just gotten back to Boston.
The next morning, he was gone.
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
Can you promise me you won't tell Tom?
His theory is based on fact.
They're not home yet.
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
He works Sundays.
He is a man of wisdom.
Tom still doesn't know who's going to be there.
Swimming at night is dangerous.
I'm just not sure.
There's a good chance that he'll be late.
I'm in the same boat as you.
I'm afraid of the same thing.
I hope something bad doesn't happen to us.
That's what I was going to say.
The actress is learning her lines.
It was not clear what she really meant.
Cheese doesn't digest easily.
It's a very good question.
Tom began to feel a little guilty.
What's all the hurry?
I'm shaken.
He finds fault with everything I say.
Do you want to play with Tom?
Smoking is harmful to the health.
It is not easy to speak naturally on the radio.
He is a learned man.
What number should I call in case of an emergency?
What if I refuse?
Where is my chainsaw?
Why don't you tell me what to do?
She does not like sushi.
Look at me when I talk to you!
I met him the day before.
It was seven thirty.
I've already read this book.
I visited her on Sunday morning.
We must evacuate.
Is there a garden in front of the house?
Where did everybody go?
The decision was easy to make.
That's why I didn't want to come here.
I yelled at Tom.
I want justice.
Don't let Tom do that.
I like taking walks.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
We're playing cards.
Can you do it faster?
This is our home.
I don't think your plan will work.
I am in your debt.
What are some foods you usually eat with red wine?
Tom is always one step ahead of us.
You're a good man.
All I think about is you.
I'll handle it.
I can give you something for your pain.
I get along well with my neighbors.
I was more than a little shocked by this.
I'd like to ask you some questions about some of the people you have working for you.
She dumped him for a richer man.
Tom is a little strange, isn't he?
The shop is just in front of the station.
He, and he alone, must go.
Why do I get the feeling you don't like Tom very much?
I want you out of here right now.
I was born on a ship.
I have to go to the store to buy some shampoo and toothpaste.
You may as well leave such a decision to your daughter.
They forgot to wake me up.
Don't go off without saying good-by.
I took it for granted that he would keep his word.
Everything has a purpose.
This is my office.
How old is that painting?
They're asleep.
I've made many mistakes in my lifetime.
How long are you planning on staying?
It almost worked.
I think you want this more than you want to admit.
This is your community.
All the girls wanted to dance with Tom.
This is a photograph of my home.
Soon after that, I began to fall asleep.
I'm so drunk that I can't feel my face anymore.
My mother was so tired that she went to bed early.
You didn't eat much lunch, did you?
You don't want to point that gun at me.
I got dumped, again.
Hey, don't do that!
I'm sorry that you didn't sleep well.
It all depends how you handle it.
If today was Sunday, I would go fishing.
We're proud of that.
We're past that.
I want to stretch my legs.
If you're happy, I'm glad.
Did you sleep well?
Come down from the tree.
The question is who will do it.
May I borrow your knife?
He put the key on the desk as usual.
I disagree with you.
Only one man survived.
We can't trust Tom anymore.
Are you sure this is the right address?
The mailman left a letter for her.
When did you visit your friends?
I'm afraid she won't accept my explanation.
He's young and single.
I found it difficult to read the book.
This bad weather is more than I bargained for.
I'm playing with my friends.
Everyone needs to work together.
We need to get you to a hospital.
I couldn't let you take all the blame.
The show starts in ten minutes.
His parents want him to go to college.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is trying to do.
Anyone could do that.
People came from all over.
I appreciate all your help.
He is a medical student.
Didn't it occur to you to shut the windows?
We're alone.
I wish you'd told me before.
Making money is not the only goal in life.
We can't do this without you.
Tom and his friends sat around the campfire and roasted marshmallows.
He's not as tall as you are.
He's likely to be late.
They must really hate me.
I'm in the tennis club.
Go away. I don't want to see you.
He was the envy of his friends.
How did you come by this painting?
She took a taxi to the museum.
How long did you stay in Canada?
It's going to be morning soon.
Someone ate all the cookies from the cookie jar.
I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench.
There's a place for us.
He is afraid of Father.
Where have you been all week?
I can't get you out of my head.
I got thirsty.
Me, too.
Tom bought a gift for his daughter.
I don't know what I was expecting.
I know that it is highly unlikely that we'll see any whales today.
Did you do what you're accused of doing?
You're the only person I know who can help me.
"He's a tiger when he's angry" is an example of metaphor.
I have no money with me.
I don't feel like taking a walk this morning.
Only four horses competed in the race.
I don't want to do it anymore.
We arrived at a compromise.
Tom has made his choice.
It didn't work out.
I talk to myself.
It's a little dated.
I know that I do not know.
I'd rather just let people talk.
I'm going to get married.
I left my card in the room.
Can you slow down a little?
His voice dropped to a whisper.
I worry too much.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
I was really shocked.
You can't cancel the meeting.
I don't particularly want to do that.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
I hope we'll see each other again sometime.
What're you writing?
You overestimate him.
To be honest, I really don't know.
They make a great team.
Being with you makes me feel happy.
What other choice did I have?
That's totally awesome.
Don't ever ask me to do that again.
No autopsy was performed.
What did you see next?
This might interest you.
If the sun were to rise in the west, I wouldn't change my mind.
They were watching television.
The readers cannot ascertain whether the news is true or not.
I admire Tom's dedication.
English is just one of over 2,700 languages in the world today.
The day we arrived was a holiday.
I want to sleep a little more.
You look like a cop.
I asked for a seat in the non-smoking section.
They're all on vacation.
He laughed off my idea.
I like listening to good music.
I met my friend on the street.
I advised him to give up smoking.
I'm not your father.
No one uses that word anymore.
The apple tree has a beautiful blossom.
Keep in mind what I tell you.
I took a bus so I wouldn't be late for my appointment.
How did you come by this painting?
Have you heard this story already?
They sat in a circle.
Where could they be?
Be punctual.
Tom said you were in Boston.
That was ours.
Can I show you something?
What else can you do?
Something's wrong with the dishwasher.
Is it OK to drink beer on your university campus?
Don't you recognize that man?
We spent all of that night, the next day, and the next night in the cellar.
It was pretty incredible.
That book is worth reading.
I stayed with a friend of mine.
Do you want me to call the police?
I don't know whether he's younger or older than I am.
That's very good.
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
It is up to you to decide what to do.
I squeezed the juice out of the oranges.
You're very nice.
She's a lot smarter than she looks.
She is blackmailing him.
There must be an easier way to do this.
I wish you could drop in at my house on your way home.
It'll be nice to see everyone again.
They gave it to me.
Where did you learn to dance like this?
We danced all night long.
This has all been a misunderstanding.
A gentleman is always kind to others.
I guess we could try doing that.
A jaywalker exposes himself to great danger.
It sounds like you had a great time.
I knew you wouldn't help us.
I have no idea what this means.
I appreciate the effort.
This knife cuts well.
I share the room with my sister.
Please write down my address.
I had a similar experience.
I'm managing.
Tom crossed the street.
He stared at that detailed miniature model of a dinosaur.
Let's change into our swimsuits and go swimming.
Keep to the left when driving.
If you stand on this stool, you can reach the top of the closet.
I think Tom feels the same way.
Stay here with us.
We need a knife for the butter.
I studied before supper.
I'll need to check my schedule.
Do you have a mobile, Tom?
Where did you go for spring break?
I wanted to discuss this with you yesterday, but you didn't seem to want to listen.
Illness prevented me from coming to school.
I don't even want to hazard a guess.
You may be right about that.
My friend only eats organic food.
Forget it!
Most of us are much more interesting than the world suspects.
The poor acoustics in the hall severely affected the audience's enjoyment of the concert.
Lie on your right side.
I'm too busy to help Tom.
Maybe I'll call you.
As we went around the corner, the lake came into view.
All of a sudden, I remembered that I couldn't pay for so many books.
Here is your bag.
It's kind of hard to explain.
She was allowed to go to the disco on condition that she was back by ten.
You're not allowed to eat those.
Put the book on the desk.
I found it difficult to make myself heard because of the noise.
Will the train leave on time?
They had once helped each other.
It was a wonderful feeling.
You're not married, are you?
Everyone was killed.
You look just like your father.
It is high time you went to bed.
Many thanks.
I don't mind leaving at six o'clock.
I would like to work with your company.
Since you have a fever, you should stay home.
She couldn't suppress her emotions.
People were lined up around the block waiting for the theater to open.
You're the only person I know who can't swim.
We had fun with it.
I'm being watched.
We all agree with you.
Not every man can be happy.
Thanks for having me.
Don't make me come after you.
Tell me it's not true.
They plan to have a party.
I want us to win.
I want to go to America someday.
He is willing enough.
I missed you last night.
This is my mother.
I'm only a customer.
He used every chance to practice English.
What do you think about this outfit?
I can't stay for dinner.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
That's a blatant lie.
Why are you running?
I'm fine with it.
We won't use that.
I never wanted that.
Who are you to decide?
I felt cheated.
I never said you were lying.
How do you know how heavy it is?
I was absent.
I'm home all the time.
It's thirty degrees below zero.
The two teams fought very hard.
I guess I need a little sleep.
Tom didn't tell me why.
I would beg to differ.
He was anxious to meet you.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
The wind is blowing from the east.
You should make up your own mind.
I didn't want to spend any more time in bed.
I took his side in the argument.
I want you to see what you've done.
You're very intelligent.
I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
I owe you a favor.
He went from Tokyo to Osaka by plane.
Let's all take off our shoes.
I feel like I know you already.
Did you like it?
Thank you for all the gifts.
Fortunately, they escaped the danger.
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter.
Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
The rebels sabotaged the railroad.
Aren't you a banker?
I thought you'd be happy.
What time and where could we meet?
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
I'm not naive.
It's like one of those.
You look very pale.
Don't be late.
My husband is a very good cook.
I'd like to do an autopsy on this body.
How many kids do you have?
I thought I heard you.
We're not sure.
We want to protect this world we have.
There are plenty of rocks.
We'll survive.
Don't you know how dangerous it is to go swimming by yourself?
You need to be more patient.
I know that I calculated the bill correctly.
I've already tried that once.
Was the work done by him alone?
Tom gave Mary something.
How many prefectures are there in Japan?
Did she like it?
I ran as fast as I could, but I missed the bus.
The president ignored the protesters outside his office.
You didn't let me finish.
That book is full of mistakes.
You don't have to go.
It is hardly raining.
I dropped out of college.
He patted me on the shoulder.
Don't worry. It's easy.
Generally speaking, a woman will live longer than a man.
Give me your belt.
Would you like to come over to my place?
I want a room with a view.
Do you think we'll have good weather tomorrow?
Tom fixed everything.
Tom has decided to stay.
My mother cleans the room.
I was just trying to impress him.
I just wanted to drop by to say hi.
The more guests there are, the more difficult it is to keep a surprise party secret.
Brush your teeth after meals.
Please be careful.
She is always fishing for compliments.
Are you going to come back?
Just do everything Tom tells you to do.
We partied all night long.
I, for one, don't believe what she said.
The time will come when your dream will come true.
Are you still in the job?
It is as if the whole sky were on fire.
When should I return the car?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
She looks as young as ever.
He promised he would help us.
What was the first concert you went to?
It wasn't me who started the fight.
You can do it, too.
The committee consists of four members.
He is poor, but happy.
Will this satisfy you?
Cats hate to get wet.
Were you obedient?
We have to clear the snow off the roof.
My brother's going to kill me.
What a shame to just endure life rather than enjoying it.
They live in a mansion.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
I'm sure of his success.
Are you ready to work?
Maybe you'd like to come with us.
You really don't have a clue, do you?
I have a ton of things to do.
A boat capsized.
It's on the eighth floor.
He played tennis all day long.
We had a lot of snow last night.
He walked across the garden.
Can we roller-skate in this park?
The thief had special tools for picking locks.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
How much more work do you have?
I can't stop Tom.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
I need this money.
I wrote her a letter every day.
They danced awkwardly together.
Just try it out.
Tom doesn't remember having said that.
You're not as young as you used to be.
There's no way to predict what you will dream tonight.
If blaming me makes you feel better, go right ahead.
When did you get back from Boston?
I live with my parents.
I'll tell you about it someday.
Only I could answer the question correctly.
Were you hurt?
Don't speak with your mouth full.
Everybody looks surprised and a little confused.
This is my new car.
The man must be insane.
I love Korean food.
What's the weather like?
He is my colleague.
You can come if you want to.
The refrigerator door was open.
Tom lives next door.
I'm afraid I didn't explain it too well.
Can we at least sit down?
We don't have secrets.
He shuddered with horror at the grisly sight.
I need an interpreter.
They want the best.
We met on Sunday.
I didn't say I was completely satisfied.
I want to know who threw the first punch.
Answer me right now.
The investment firm tricked customers into buying worthless stock.
She didn't try to evade the truth.
Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish.
What are some of the most popular foods eaten in Spain?
Now that he is old, it is your duty to go look after him.
You don't have to explain anything.
I'd like to be considered for the job.
He's been staying at that hotel since five days ago.
You are a bad person.
I heard an unusual noise.
We need experts.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
I'd like to go to Boston someday.
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
You have such beautiful, hazel eyes.
What were you doing then?
Tom advised us not to do that.
I can't believe I'm going to lose my job.
Tom hasn't forgiven anybody.
I locked myself out of my house.
They burned all the documents.
I saw what you did.
I had fun.
Save Tom.
I'm not ashamed.
That was you, wasn't it?
Now this is more like it.
He didn't know what to say, so he remained silent.
Tom has begun writing a new book.
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
Stop Tom.
Green suits you.
He was a man of great ambition.
She sings well.
They left early.
Don't hesitate to tell me if you need anything.
He's not perfect.
He was late for the 7:30 bus.
We could die.
This sentence contains an error.
I figured it out by myself.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
You should apologize to Tom for being late.
What difference does it make if people are looking at us?
See what happens when you tell the truth?
Who buys this type of art?
The petals floated on the surface of the water.
You freaked me out.
I have three chickens in my house.
Tom says he wants a puppy for Christmas.
Tom writes to me at least once a week.
Whose paintings are these?
I'll help you to the best of my ability.
I am not ready yet.
What don't you have?
This would've been your room if you'd decided to stay with us.
That movie star has many fans.
Aren't you annoyed by that?
You've got to tell Tom how you feel.
Good luck. You'll need it.
I'm a total wreck.
We are all set.
Are you satisfied with the political situation in your country?
He scarcely ever watches TV.
You are a teacher.
This is a funny sentence.
My father will often read the newspaper during meals.
Could I help you?
Take as much as you want.
I'm not scared of anybody.
Can I help you?
It looks like Tom is really enjoying himself.
You're the only person I know that can't swim.
They've defused the bomb successfully.
My grandfather goes for walks on days when the weather is good.
You always want to control everything.
They look healthy.
People lived in villages.
She has long arms and legs.
Have a good time.
Why are you jealous of me?
Don't complain.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Beautiful poppies were growing beside the road.
I'm a little tired today.
What did you say?
I wish there were a French translation of this book.
From personal experience, I know that any encounter with him will leave a bad taste in your mouth.
I think you're wrong.
I advised him to come back at once.
Does any other country fan the flames of patriotism as much as America?
What a loser!
Never did I expect to see her in such a place.
She doesn't admit that she is wrong.
I was concerned.
We need a plan.
I fell asleep while reading.
I thought you said you couldn't eat raw fish.
I could use some help in the kitchen.
It's gotten better.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Have you already decided on your thesis topic?
That doctor specializes in helping those with eating disorders.
I love winter.
Tom'll understand.
That doesn't really make any sense.
What year were you born?
Don't you want to know where I was?
Some people are difficult to please.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
Shut the door, please.
Come near the fire.
Tom says he doesn't like chocolate ice cream.
Nobody asked.
What kind of meal did you eat?
It's not us who did it.
He is making great progress in English.
Are you a natural blonde?
What are you doing?
Soldiers are used to danger.
My father visited my uncle in the hospital.
Come see me again tomorrow.
Why don't you start by telling us who went with you?
I'd be delighted if you'd come with me.
If they find us, we're dead.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
His attempt to escape was successful.
He always hums while working.
The police covered the body with a sheet.
Would you like me to massage your shoulders?
He cut some branches off the tree.
He abandoned his family and went to live in Tahiti.

Tom does that every Monday afternoon.
I think we can.
Let's learn this poem by heart.
Do you want to come over and watch a movie?

I was the happiest man on earth.
Here is my bicycle.
I hope he will overlook it.
Tom's arm brushed against mine.
These are the originals.
You never told me you were married.
He has a video.
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
I don't think it's possible to do that.
His aim is to become a lawyer.
Just leave me alone.
I'm so embarrassed.
Tom doesn't want Mary to get involved.
Look what I made for Tom.
You are early.
How on earth can you speak that language?
Where is your house?
It all happened quickly.
Are we leaving?
He hit me in the face.
Safety is the primary concern.
She gave him the brush off.
"Who is it?" "It's me."
I wrote some poems last weekend.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Do you know how old I am?
Do you have enough information to go on?
I know what they mean.
I hate all of them.
I wouldn't want to miss the party.
I cannot afford a holiday.
Mr. Jackson is a very good teacher.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
I don't like that either.
I met some friends while I was waiting for a bus.
I can't wait to eat it.
Turn the sound off.
Why do you think so?
Like it or not, you must do it.
We had many bitter experiences during the war.
I'm counting on you.
They abandoned the sinking ship.
I can't read this.
We didn't stay home yesterday.
He will arrive there about five o'clock.
Where did you go fishing?
It serves you right.
He must have studied English hard.
Tom will be here tonight.
We played a lot of games at the party.

I'm no match for you.

Go home now.

Do as I told you.
How is your weekend going so far?
If you were more ambitious, you could go a long way.
I'm going to drop in on her next week.
She raced him down the hill.
I was afraid of that.
I have no clue what you're talking about.
He took a book from the bookshelf.
It took her a long time to choose a hat.
Security was increased in the city.
Where can I reach you?
She took a pen out of her pocket.
I've read all about you.
It was very beautiful.
I was terribly frightened.
Have you heard from her?
Correct the errors if there are any.
I wonder why they left my name off the list.
Let's sit down here.
Can you remember the first word you learned in English?
I had a very high fever.
I received an email from Tom this morning.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
He didn't want to do it.
Does your dog bite?
I strongly urge you to follow my advice.
You know I have to go.
This is new.
He works with me at the office.
I respect your opinion.
Do you know how long they have been married?
You're opportunistic.
Life is often compared to a journey.
I want to know why you're doing this.
All during my trip I could not keep you out of my mind.
I recognized the name.
I don't know what happened.
We have to consider the possibility that Tom was involved in the robbery.

Strange to say, no one voted for the candidate.

I need a red pen.
What a waste of water!
Who ate the last cookie?
Did someone follow us here?
Thank you for the Christmas gift.
There was no damage.
You're too naive.
When I painted this picture, I was 23 years old.
I cleared the table.
I prefer going out to staying at home.
I want you to go see the nurse.
Don't say anything.
Don't they drive you mad?
When did all this happen?
She was washing the dishes then.
I don't know who else to turn to for help.
This is a kind of watermelon.
I think it's time for me to leave for school.
Do you have a credit card?
He is fluent in Chinese.
It is no use complaining.
Why not start now?
I think you're underestimating Tom.
I'll be very careful.
What mileage do you get with this car?
There is no grass on the moon.
She's young enough to be your daughter.
It happened at a quarter past eleven.
Don't ask me to do this.
You don't know what that means to me.
Who's the author?
We surrender.
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
I've asked you this question before.
The girls danced to music.

We never lose.
He is a painter.
Do you have a bicycle?

Why couldn't you come on Saturday?
Maybe that's the real problem.
The weather is beautiful today.
This offer is good for five days.
You should quit smoking.
I hate this town.
I get a call from her once in a while.
It's not a dog.
Tom has to be stopped.
I love that shirt.

I believe that he comes here.
That book had a lot of pages.

They did it in front of the staff.
How long does it last?
Don't push me!
He lacks motivation.
All I found is a pair of scissors.
She believes her son is still alive.
I can't just leave. I have to tell the boss I'm leaving.
She deliberately exposed him to danger.
I know that this is important to you.
What could they possibly want from us?
We'll go when it quits raining.
Don't push me.
If only I could go skiing.
Tom certainly fooled Mary.
What on earth does this have to do with me?
I can't put up with the way he spits.
My family goes skiing every winter.
Yesterday, I bought a red car.
Please get all of your junk out of this room.
Having seen him before, I knew him at once.
We left the final decision to him.
I don't have a car, but my sister does.
Her sister is not going to America.
Tom is busy making breakfast for his family.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
Her composition is very good except for a few errors in spelling.
Do you need any help doing that?
I have no regrets.
He slept in the car.
What is this called?
I had a sandwich for lunch.
I finally have everything I need.

Will you please go there?
Did you talk to your new classmates yesterday?
He doesn't understand me.
You can invite any person you like.
You have a point there.
The door may be locked.
Do you want me to rub your shoulders?
Don't give it a second thought.
I'm too old for you.
I want to teach history when I grow up.
You're really selfish.
He is a gentleman among gentlemen.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
We took an examination in math last week.
He got what he deserved.
His childhood was harsh.
I don't know a thing about her.
Tom said he was starving.
He is always finding fault with others.
Can I speak to the person in charge?
I've never seen a whale that big.
I used to fish for hours on holidays.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
I like the way she laughs at my jokes.
Please show me another one.
Would you like something to eat?
I was offended.
I was convicted.
I have enough money to buy it.
This is so much fun.
Why would you want me?
I haven't gotten any letters from Tom yet.
They gathered at a farm in New York State.
I feel bad about that.
They accused me of being a liar.
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
The tetanus shot hurt more than the dog bite.
I'm very tired.
I'm psychic.
I think he's going to be sick.
Don't kid me!

It will clear up soon.
Stop acting like a baby.

I forgot to write my name on the exam.
The kids are driving me crazy.
You don't have to explain.
I asked Tom if he would go, too.
I just needed some water.
Milk has to be kept at a relatively low temperature.
She advised him to leave earlier.

How do I know that you're not going to do that again?
Can you explain your answer?
Did you volunteer us?
It looks like a cow.
What will the weather be like tomorrow?
No casualties were reported.
Let's go say hi to them.
I'm proud of you guys.
I was going to write to you, but I forgot.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I had to work last weekend.
I think it's too risky.
I want to be in a rock band.
How could you be so cruel?
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
I can't promise Tom will talk to you.
I think it's wonderful.
I'm being promoted.
Don't risk insulting your boss.
First, I want to eat a little bit of cake.
It's a rental.
She ran out of paper.
We have no money.
I've been looking for it all morning.
Where did you find my umbrella?
I wish today were Friday.
I gave him my address.
I want new business cards.
There are some eggs in the box.
Can they give you something for that?
I like to take things apart to see what makes them tick.
You're in pain, aren't you?
It was not my intention.
She went to see him reluctantly.
Let's pretend we are ninjas.
Our dreams came true.
Could you stay and help me?
That hotel was very near the lake.
Two beers, please.
I have no insurance.
They look sad.
He flatly refused her requests for help.
Can you remember anything?
Does the applicant have suitable abilities to carry out the job?
Tell me it's not true.
She is my daughter.
Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking.
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
The water was hot.
The company wants to hire 20 people.

For the time being, he's staying at a neighboring hotel.
He stopped drinking.
What were you doing before this?
Don't ask me to do that.
He wrote a letter yesterday.
Excuse me, is there a hotel around here?
Let's visit my grandpa this weekend.
Are you sure you're not tired?
You're too tense.
I thought you'd got lost.
I was on the wrong track.
I thought you were a friend.
Did he go there?
You are good.
I've never seen a whale that big.
I didn't know Tom played tennis.
I was out of town on vacation.
Time is running out.
We are going to climb that mountain.
I think Tom is loyal.
Can you come into my office, please?
The station is in the center of the city.
If it were not for his idleness, he would be a nice fellow.
He exhausted all his energy.
The boys are excited.
I immediately built a fire.
That gave me a rough idea.
I see they've put you to work.
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
She laid her baby on the bed.
The three were arrested.
We haven't done that all year.

He went fishing in a river near the village.
Where did he do it?
I want to know what it is.
He showed off his new car.
Babies are interesting to watch.
She treated him like a king.
He said hello to the woman.
I am going to swim a lot this summer.
I regret that I lied.
They are jealous of us.
I used to not do that.
I was really surprised.
I'm very tired, but I can't get to sleep.
Anybody want a lift?
It often snows here.
Can you beat that?
Is there anyone in the room?
I can see it in your eyes.
The whole company stood in silence for a few moments, as a tribute to the dead.
Cambodia appealed to the United Nations for help.
We are about to leave here.
Does that make you sad?

I want to watch this.
Tom never gave up.
Tom doesn't seem to get it.
I'm back.
You're ambitious.
He is very afraid of dogs.
He's always complaining about something.
He never lies.
Don't try to trick us.
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
You're so impatient.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
I've heard that some people sleep in bathtubs.
We're going upstairs.

May I begin?
Mass production reduced the price of many goods.
It is not easy to learn a foreign language.
You know what they say.
You were drunk, weren't you?
Tom helped us all.
Let me call my lawyer.
Are you sure about that?
Your fries are getting cold.
Tom was surprised by Mary's reaction.
He arrived as soon as he could.
She is fresh from college, so she has no experience.
We've already sent a message to Tom.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
So where were you?
Please give me a piece of bread.
Keep an eye on him.
Look! The airplane is taking off.
She is two years older than you.
That's very impressive.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I am sorry.

For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
Aren't you satisfied?
The library is on the second floor.
Can you guys tell us where we are?
I wish the fedora would come back in style.
I am seventeen years old, too.
No matter how hard he tried, my opinion didn't change.
Love is blinding you.
I just want to be different.
I don't want to lose my boyfriend.
Just as he was going out, there was a great earthquake.
You must be in love.
Madeira is the name of a wine.
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.

I forgave you a long time ago.

She had a narrow escape.
Call us when you get there.
They play together a lot.
Let's sit on the bench.
These are mine.
No one knew who did it.
Do you have more than one copy of this key?
Tell me where you went.
It is impossible for you to succeed.
A man called on you last night.
I don't know if you remember me, but we met a couple of years ago in Boston.
We'll be there in thirty minutes.
They admired the lovely scenery.
I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you.
That's really not the point.
I didn't say I liked it.
Tell Tom I'll be there as soon as I can.
It was difficult to remove the coffee stain.
I don't think I can fix it.

Trust is earned.
It seems that he is aware of the fact.
What do you do on Sunday?
You're bossy.
Can anything else be done?
Father is in his office.
They revolted against the government.

Come back soon.

I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
I don't want to ask you anything.
I can't imagine a world without electricity.
This doesn't seem to be a serious problem.
The robber bashed her head in.
There are exceptions.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
I'll see Tom tomorrow.
So, what do you mean?
Yesterday, I bought a book.
I have not seen him lately.
This shop has more candy than that shop.
Tom was pardoned by the governor.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
Now leave us.
Tell Tom.
I don't know why that should surprise me.
Where did you get all these?
Wait till six.
She cannot stop us.
They always complain.
Did you telephone him?
I didn't want to bug you.
Cats are smarter than you think.
I have no friend to talk with.
Children want to act like grown-ups.
Tom is a compulsive hoarder.
They were unimpressed.
How do you say "love" in French?

I think Tom has made a mistake.
I felt as if I had no choice.
I want this room cleaned.
I have another plan.
Mary is prettier than her sister.
He ran the fastest of all.
He makes believe he is rich.
They tried to swim to safety.
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
You're not bruised.
It would be better if you didn't eat before going to bed.
I love old books.
I can't wait any longer.
I'd forgotten all about that.
I finished first.
We've an obligation to do that.
Carelessness often results in accidents.
I love hanging out with you.
Sounds like you're having fun.
Tom knows a girl named Mary.
Tom will try to convince Mary to accept your offer.
Do you have any plans for today?
Don't let anything else distract us.
I like history.
Tom is on the honor roll.
Could you go to the store?
We don't have any strawberry ice cream.
You can't both be right.
I think it's too late.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Put out the light.
I regret that this all happened.
Help yourself.
My parents pushed me to quit the baseball club.
I don't know what to eat for dinner.
Are you sure?
How's the water here?
Please leave.
She picked up the phone.
Can I speak to you?
How do you make a box?
I'm very serious.
What a treasure!
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
I must manage on a small income.
Don't talk to me about work.
You're worried, aren't you?
You didn't need to come.
When you love someone, you'll do anything to make that person happy.
Tell us the truth now.
He was the only witness of the accident.
I was planning to call him, but changed my mind and didn't.
I was sure of it.
Do I have your permission to do so?
That's how it is.
These kittens are so cute and cuddly.
She gave me a strange look.
I felt cheated.
I didn't know you were so tired.
I will be leaving for Australia next month.
Do you still play the piano?
I heard a noise coming from the next room.

He donated countless pieces to the museum.
You're crazy.
Never mind what she says.
Stand up straight.
Tom felt very tired.
There's no need to panic. There's plenty of time.
He opened the window to let in some fresh air.
I have already written a letter.
This has never happened before.
I have many talents.
Tom is the father of three children.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
We weren't all that hungry.
Would you lend me some money?
They are very proud of being students of that college.
I bet you didn't know that.
Tom jumped.
My mom doesn't want me to play with you.
He didn't give me much advice.
We took turns with the driving.
Cleveland was not sure the boy was his son.
He added that he didn't believe it.
Take that back.
They don't talk at all.
Tom's impeccable manners made a big impression on Mary's parents.
You're too loud.
The city is gaining popularity as a major tourist destination.
Let's leave it up to him.
I wish you could stay the night.
I'll get these.
Man is the only animal that can laugh.
He gave us quite a lot of trouble.
You don't want much, do you?
It was Sunday yesterday.
I cannot disclose any information about the informant.
I feel like such a fool.
You're wasting our time.
Have you ever known them to come on time?
You're mistaken. That's not what I said.
She looks pretty no matter what she wears.
That tower you see over there is the Eiffel Tower.

You look very good in blue.
I wrote this book.
It's dead.
I'd like you to look after my dog during my absence.
Could you please tell me who you are?
I need to see you tonight.
Can we drop this?
This is a lot more fun than studying.
I was good.
Mary is Tom's girlfriend.
Suicide is an act of desperation.
She cleared the dishes from the table after dinner.
He lost a book.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Can you give me your telephone number, please?
That took guts.
How do you know they're looking for us?
Get into the car.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
We have to move.
Bring food.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a teacher.
We can live with that.
Nobody came.
I have some extra tickets for the concert.
I think it's time for us to leave.
You'll have to learn all these dates by rote.
I didn't want to involve you.
Tom is going nuts.
We're prisoners.
Just then I heard footsteps in the stairwell.
Try not to disappoint me.
I'd be curious to know what Tom has to say.
They will get married next month.
Stop that.
She kissed away the boy's tears.
Choose between the two.
You don't have the guts.
I saw him.
You must do it even if you don't want to.
You should check your blood pressure.
She is used to living alone.

Two tickets to San Diego, please.
I can't eat that food.
You must show respect to your guests.
My hobby is reading novels.
I thought you'd want it back.
I'm stunned.
Tom asked me why I was late.
I know Tom better than I know you.
Hand me a towel.
Tom prefers not to talk about it.
Do you want to get drunk?
Could you keep your eye out for my car keys?
How could you be so cruel?
We played on the beach.
You didn't mean it, did you?
That sounds very tempting.
It's sad.
Let's get together tomorrow.
What are your thoughts on this?
He doesn't know any better.
I feel empowered.
I think there's been a mistake.
So, are you going to tell me who you are?
She divorced him.
I don't have to think about it.
Would you just shut up?
The children were so noisy that I couldn't study.
Is there room in your car for me?
He was born on July 28th, 1888.
Did you rent an apartment?
Everybody's tired.
You're very skeptical.
Which shoes do you like?
You're big.
I suppose that's why you don't like me so much.
I don't have a cat.
I don't feel like working.
He expressed his belief in her honesty.
Mary wants both a career and a family.
My car isn't powerful enough.
She is practicing the violin now.
Your English has improved considerably.
You're very good.
It was cloudy, with occasional rain.
Smiling sadly, she began to talk.
I'm forgetful.
You're single.
I am very interested in music.
Everything went well with him.
It doesn't matter if you do that or not.
Will you do me a favor?
We tend to make mistakes.
I need a lawyer who can speak French.
I have to study for a biology test.
You won everything.
What is the ultimate purpose of education?
That's a pretty strange-looking bracelet you're wearing.
Please excuse my ignorance.
I don't need to go to college.
I don't know how to reply to that question.
The airplane landed on my father's farm.
I think you're going to enjoy spending time with Tom.
I want you to work harder.
Go back to bed.
It's no secret.
I've never heard of that.
Of all these cakes I like this one best.
Do you remember what she said?
His explanation was not satisfactory.
As soon as the new teacher entered the classroom, the students began to applaud.
Are you children all right?
I have nothing to fall back on.
He has two daughters, both married.
I didn't see you come in.
Bad weather kept us from going out.
You weren't there, were you?
Can you walk on stilts?
Do you think it was easy for me?
I don't understand the analogy.
Tom began to dance.
This newspaper is free.
Let's sit down on the bench.
You have been a great mentor to me.
Take one of these.
"Are you students?" "Yes, we are."
Do as you like.
Don't hesitate to ask if you need help.
Where did Tom go yesterday?
Tom didn't have to thank me.
So what's your problem?
There's still so much left to do.
She was watching the dead leaves falling.
The snow melts in spring.
I can't swim.
I can't win.

You don't have the guts.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I've lost your phone number.
A fish swims by moving its tail.
I know her by sight, but I've never spoken to her.
Where is her family?
Here's the key to your room.
When were you born?
How long did you stay at the party?
Each student has a locker.
That's a little unfair.
If I were you, I would apply for the job.
He went to see her while she stayed in London.
Compare your answers with the teacher's.
I was sleepy.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
You can't blame me.
I thought you'd changed.
She didn't want to sell the book.
I'll go check.
Will it make a difference?
What're you all doing in the library?
Sit beside me.
I suppose that's all right.
Tom was so hungry that he ate dog food.
The mandate of the president lasted five years.
Can you recommend a good book?

They were unimpressed.
This room has space for fifty people.
Did you read it all?
I mean no harm.
Do you have psychic powers?
What cold drinks do you have?
That will do.
Tom is still in the bathroom.
I'll go home.
I need some time to think about it.
I don't think I can help you very much.
That couldn't be helped.
Why didn't you say it like that?
He stood up.
I know Tom saved Mary's life.
I wouldn't count on it.
I suppose you're hungry.
I have three times as much money as you.
Where do I sleep?
Can we trust Tom to do that?
She asked him to call her later.
Go and see him in person.
Tom just got married.
Where ever did you buy it?
Please put that on the table.
It was a fine sunny day.
I can't imagine what you've gone through.
Did Tom kill himself?
He declined the job-offer very politely.
Nobody backed up what I said.
I had to go back.

She is first in line.
Look at that red building.
Don't worry about what I did.
I cannot agree to his proposal.
I want to do this later.
The local boys got into a fight with a rival group from a neighboring town.

Take what you need.
He's a professional photographer.
We're quitting.
What did I just do?
I applied for a visa.
You ran a red light.
I am completely out of breath.
I want to talk to you about this report.
What're we waiting for?
I couldn't bring myself to throw your picture away.
Thank you all for that.
Tom said no.
He looked me in the eye.
What did you think of the movies we saw yesterday?
Tom has a difficult job.
I like all of them.
Can you teach me how to ride a horse?
Let's speak English.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
People are getting antsy.
I was a bit disappointed.
I feel like I've been cheated.
She spoke wisely.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
It's not just a theory.
I want you to stay here until I get back.
Pack your gear.
I need a favor.
I knew someone would come rescue us eventually.
Draw a circle.
I like what you did with your hair.
They all knew.
I'm sure that's what Tom would've wanted.
He ran away with the money.
They grew closer.
The water is lukewarm.
Tom looks like a girl.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
What does this note mean?
He is very brave.
Are you having a good time?
I will try next week.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
Tom was heartbroken when his dog died.
Please don't die!
What're you all dressed up for?
Is that you?
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
They found the room empty.
Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to watch her son growing up.
We're not desperate yet.
Don't you want to know?
Do you want to take that risk?
No one will help us.
Those who violate the rules will be punished.
It would be crazy not to do that.
I feel good.
All I want you to do is talk to us.
Is the Orient too foreign for you?
Give me a hand with this.
I made him carry the briefcase.
The fish aren't biting today.
I could be away for some time.
How long have you two been together?
They're jittery.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
Men, dogs, fish, and birds are all animals.
I know my father will help me.
They didn't want me to examine it.
You won't be shot.
The last thing I want to do is cause you any problems.
I think Tom may be right this time.
I will get in touch with you.
He asked his teacher stupid questions.
He imitated the works of Van Gogh.
I wasn't aware of that.
Tom concentrated on his work.
What's in this box?
Get me another lawyer.
I've been looking forward to meeting you again.
They are at 229 Broadway Avenue.
I want to make sure there is enough.
Tom and Mary are really good friends.
You should apologize.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
She hired him as a programmer.
Why don't you get a job?

I want to stay at the Hilton Hotel.
Tom shaved off his mustache.
I have nothing to say with regard to that problem.
Let's sit by the fireplace.
That requires careful consideration.
Is there a milkman?
Don't touch me.
The man was bitten by a dog.
He rested his hand on my shoulder.
What do you think caused him to lose his job?
How's everything going?
You said you figured out why.
We have to save him immediately.
They have no natural predators.
I plan on being there in person.
Call me when you are ready to go.
He decided not to wait any longer.
What's that?

What does it contain?
What a wonderful party!
Are you retarded or something?
I'm fine.
You're doing it right.
Is this radio yours?
I like spring.
The meeting was just about over.
Where is your house?
I don't want you to see me naked.

You can't kill someone that's already dead.
They couldn't find out why your car won't start.

Everybody wants to protect you.
Be nicer to your brother.
No one ate the cake.
He seemed unconscious of my presence.
I did it for you.
What was the outcome?
I was happy there.
Tom hasn't eaten at home in a long time.
We've decided to move the meeting to next Sunday.
I want to know how they do that.
I never wanted to compete with you.
Tom began flirting with Mary.
I have left my umbrella in a bus.
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
You are very brave.
I didn't know what to say to him.
A week has seven days.
You'll be all right again in a couple of days.
I am grateful to you for your kindness.
How does he do it?
Bring it back when you're done.
Tom was probably born in Boston.
Do you have any idea what Tom was doing in Boston?
I felt naked.
He would often sit for hours without doing anything.
This book is a whodunit.
We will be living in England.
That's just what I needed.
I bought an electric car.
Tom agrees.
Invite whoever you like.
I can't believe my eyes.
What are you cooking today?
This is a bit embarrassing.
I'm not sure that that's all true.
We're not allowed to do that.
Tom lost his hearing.
It wasn't an easy decision.
You're awesome.
I heard the front doorbell ring.
A horse passed my house.
I've been all over Europe.

I like blue.
Look at my arm.
I can't find my glasses. I may have left them behind in the train.
Opportunity waits for no one.
What should we do if he comes late?
To laugh at everything that is done or said is stupid, but not to laugh is even more foolish.
I won't hold it against you.
Let me explain it with a diagram.
I feel bad that I can't come today.
I'm not afraid to try.
How do you spell that word?
We don't have to go.
I don't think I can do it.
Tom would make a good teacher.
She is good at making up interesting stories.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
He saw the surprise on my face.
It's dangerous here.
I knew something strange was going on.
They were all there.
Tom began to brush his teeth.
No one speaks that language anymore.
That did occur to me.
I'm not sure what you were thinking.
Where do you have pain?
Your death will not have been in vain.
He saved us all.
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.

Do you know what that means?
You're a terrible person.
We'll travel together.
It's only money.
What happened to the other one?
He sat next to her.
Just say yes or no.
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
First of all, let me speak about myself.
I got fined.
We all like him.
Has Tom told Mary that he's poor?
Who's the loser?
Tom wishes he could fly.
The child was hiding in the box.
We nearly starved.
You look Japanese.
I've never beaten Tom at chess.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
We gave blood to help the child.
This work is difficult for us.
I'd say you did well.

Get out of the van.

The water is pure.
I want to find a box for this.
I think Tom believes everything Mary says.
They're sending help.
We'll have lived here for two years next April.

My father likes strong coffee.
I saw something interesting.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
Your parents are expecting your call.

I trust you.
I know somebody who speaks French very well.
I can't do without your advice.
We have to learn all the songs before the end of the week.

I had to tell somebody.
Please excuse my being late.
Tom isn't conservative.

If only I had a pretty dress like that!
The waves swallowed up the boat.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
Don't keep me waiting.
I know you're not serious.
I'm not going to stay if you don't want me to.
How did you come by this painting?
Tom asked me if I was sleepy.
I learned a lot from you.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
I'm all yours.
I'm not here on business.
If you could go back in time, what would you change?
Are you following me?
Please be careful.
I just assumed you'd be here.
We're really married.
My daughter was cheated.
Did I break it?
I need to ask you for a little favor.
Where is the cat?
Don't remind me.
Let's not be enemies.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
I can hear you loud and clear.
Tom pays his taxes.
What's wrong with you?
I really think we should talk.
I am ready.
They never found out the truth.
He's a friend of my brother's.
Tom borrowed my car.
He traveled with only a dog for company.
I have to be back home by seven.
What are you trying to hide?
I must admit that I don't like contemporary music much.
She couldn't help bursting into laughter.
That's really impressive.
Tom hurried out of the building.
I wish you'd stop saying that.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
I'll be with you in a minute.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
I am waiting my turn.
I appreciate your taking the time to see me.
He lost his way in the woods.
A man came to visit you last night.
Don't make me come back here.
I'm a respectable businessman.
The world population grows by close to eight million per year.
I know how hard this is.
It will probably snow tomorrow.
They're not expensive.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Because of that virus, many elephants lost their lives.
Why are you so busy today?
I wish to make a complaint.
The baby seemed to be fast asleep.
In my city, the temperature is one degree above zero.
I'm not used to this kind of work.
I don't know how to draw a bird.
She gave me a wonderful present.
Are you kidding me?
He fell into the river.
I do love you.
I made a list of things I needed to do.
I think we both know why I'm here.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I never get invited to parties.
He wants to go.
I dislike all of them.
We are encouraged to use our imagination.
We noticed the man enter her room.
Would you like some help?
I was able to swim well when I was a child.
I rescued you.
He got sick during the trip.
I was eventually released.
I didn't try to kill myself.
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
I really appreciate you helping me.
You should probably go, Tom.
Tom's wrong.
I think we're out of gas.
You'd better not go there.
Grab the end of this rope.
You've got to move.
From now on, I'm going to say what's on my mind.
I gave in to her demands.
Are you ready to begin?
I don't like summer.
You must teach me what you know.
I thought you had learned that by now.
Let's talk over a cup of tea, shall we?
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
Christmas is fast approaching.
I visited Boston.
I ask your forgiveness.
Come with us, please.
Want a drink?
I was fortunate to make his acquaintance.
I didn't know you had a week off last month.
That's my business.
I need to know by tomorrow.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Mary is expecting a girl.
People believe what they see.
Get Tom to help you.
Tell me you're not serious!
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
Are you sure they can do this?
You've come too early.
We want to help Tom.
Did you take him home?
I'd suggest the following change.
How dare you speak like that?
I want you to find out about that.
She made up her mind to go abroad.
That's an excellent idea.
I'd like to talk to the head of security.
That never was an issue.
That is how he always treats me.
Wow! You've lost a lot of weight.
Have you ever broken a bone?
This is preposterous.
I held the umbrella over her.
I've got a bad hangover.

I have to pay more attention to myself.
I was on a trip to India.

If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
You are important.
My family is not that large.
A typhoon is approaching Japan.
It's already time to go home.
They danced until six in the morning.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
Tom could probably tell us why.
It's funny.
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Tom went back into his office.
Let me rephrase it.
I didn't hear what you said.
We're not that far from my place.
I think I can prove it.
He hastily packed his bags.
He works as a busboy.
I want to meet with Tom.
Can you ski?
Do you know his brother?
I think time will solve the problem.
He pushed me gently.
You're beautiful.
I can't do this alone.
They are boiling water for tea.
This was not supposed to happen.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
Have you ever seen a monkey?
I haven't seen you in ages.
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Tom has lost both of his parents.
Do you want some water?
How about going to see a movie with me?

Why are you wearing a tux?
You hate Tom, don't you?
I just didn't want you to go there by yourself.
He is planning to launch his business.
I must learn this poem by heart.
How about calling it a day?
I'd like my coffee weak.
We don't need you anymore.
He hurt himself when he fell.
Give me a couple minutes to get dressed.
If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know.
I'd like to go to my room.
I'm sick of this war.
I've only seen it once.
What did you make?
Tom wants to be a celebrity.
I had too much to drink last night.
I'm not the coach.
I need to borrow your pen.
Can you help me with the washing up?
You're so impatient.
What do your children usually eat for breakfast?
It will grow back.
This is a beautiful piece of meat.
Please stay.
I was reading a book while walking.
It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Have yourself a drink.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Will you please put that in simpler words?
Give the dog some water.
You need to decide what kind of person you want to be.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
I had to change the rules.
I saw her again.
He worked harder than ever.
You don't want to tell me why, do you?
Be merciful.
I never stay anywhere long enough to make friends.
If you want quality, pay for it.
Are they actually friends?
He was absent from school because he was sick.
Are both of you still single?
Happy Thanksgiving!
They'll be all right.
I just feel a little dizzy.
Do you trust anyone?
All but one were present.
She didn't run fast enough to catch the bus.
I took part in the sporting event.
She didn't want him to play poker.
Tom is in bed.
Please read that book.
That's not your job.

Let's try something a little simpler.
Don't you remember anything?
You're very forward.
I saw her just the other day.
Thanks for the food.
I'm going to see Tom.
The bomb will explode in 10 seconds.
Where can I try this on?
You should begin with easier questions.
It's a beautiful painting.
I don't keep a diary.
This soup is too salty to eat.
I feel like I should say something, but I don't know what.
There's no mention of it here.
A tree is known by its fruit.
Tom can't even read.
Tom said he hated me.
They found him guilty.
For goodness' sake, don't say that!
I'm allowing you to go.
Can this possibly be the right address?
I wonder if what I wrote was correct.
I'm not used to this heat.
The two of us split up last year.
Don't talk to the driver.
That doesn't make sense to me.

We were concerned.
You need to sleep.
The employee was escorted off the premises.
We can do it right now.

May I ask you another question?
That may not be necessary.
I want to get as far away from here as I can.

Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
She handed me the letter without saying anything.
I can't understand the problem.
They'll be all right.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I can't afford a pay cut.
Tom and Mary agreed on a price.
I don't know how to make you happy.
I work in a flower shop.
How do you want to die?
Tom said he doesn't know anyone in Boston.
I just redecorated.
Let's begin.
He made fun of my accent.
This is excellent wine.
Everyone is waiting in the other room.
I wish he would write more often.
I gave the boy what little money I had.
I know your father very well.

Words failed me.
Our parents should be taken care of.

That's true, too.
That's totally awesome.
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
Do you take me for a fool?

Try this cake.
I'm ashamed of what I did.
Do you want to go to the station with me?
Do you have a license to fly a plane?
What's wrong with running around your house naked?
I just didn't believe it.
Please feel free to ask me any question.
It is no good to you.
You'd better go to bed.
Get some sleep, okay?
All of them are not present.
He's an advocate of barefoot running.
I have a black and white dog.
The website is down.
Don't make me say it.
You could be a little nicer to your brother.
Tom was here before I was.
I'd like to try this.
What have we gotten ourselves into?
Would you like to sing?
Are you envious?
Tom is sitting at his desk.
We all agree with you.
I need a knife.

Do you have something to show me?

I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
I wish you'd stop saying that.
I love coffee.
Do you think that my way of teaching is wrong?
I am bound to him by a close friendship.
Tell Tom to shut up.
Show me your passport, please.
I want to do this at home.

I'm not married yet.
Don't do that now.
I have a pair of red shoes.
It is Tom's ambition to go to the moon.
The murder happened between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.

It's OK with me.
Let me help you with that.
Choose one person.
I often meditate on the meaning of life.
It's none of your business.

Could I have the bill, please?
