I think we can help each other.
She is blackmailing him.
That's not why.
I can't believe that actually happened.
You have changed since I saw you last year.
The old man was run over and immediately taken to hospital.
I thought maybe I could buy you a drink.
Look what I made for Tom.
Come up here.
I'm not hungry at all.
Are you home?
I'm grounded.
I'm not English.
It's my fault, not yours.
I've been working here for many years.
His brazen act of defiance almost cost him his life.
There is a red rose in the vase.
That's what I'm trying to do.
Can we believe that?
You gotta get more organized.
We're not friends anymore.
If you don't want to miss the train, you'd better hurry.
I gave her all the money I had.
I've decided to tell the truth.
He teaches Arabic.
The car broke down on the way to the airport.
Are you getting enough oxygen?
Many of the things Pizzaro had heard about the Inca treasure were true.
Don't tell me how to spend my money.
I have a bone to pick with you.
I am ready to go with you.
He is very careful.
Coffee keeps me awake.
I didn't realize you were serious.
He could not speak French well.
I parked on the left side of the street just in front of the school.
I didn't tell anybody.
You're not in a hurry, are you?
I want to kiss you.
I've never tried doing that.
You should face up to the reality.
It wasn't an accident.
Not all of those books are useful.
She loves shopping.
I found out when we're supposed to arrive.
Tom loves Mary.
Aren't you satisfied?
When is the breakfast served?
Don't you want to help?
Tom criticized Mary for not doing the job correctly.
I thought you understood.
The bank was run by private citizens.
Let her talk.
I tried my best, but I still lost the race.
I'm retired, too.
I want my father to see the movie.
Turn it up.
We all work.
I told Tom I wanted to go with him.
She did not visit me on Sunday but on Monday.
It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
Tom told me he didn't get enough sleep.
I know you want to help him.
This room is too big.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
Should I close?
What do I have to do now that I'm registered?
We were so tired that we turned in about 9:00 last night.
Their teacher praised them.
Don't rely on him.
That's remarkable.
What time does it close?
Please give me a break.
I hurt my foot.
Your driver's license has expired.
He's a well-known television personality.
Tom told me he was retired.
I didn't understand anything, either.
Do you want me to help you?
Did you speak with him about your projects?
I think Tom is in his office.
The shower is broken.
I wonder if this really works.
He takes a bath every morning.
He fed his dog at the same time every day.
Why are you so angry?
Come soon.
Tests start next week.
I could sure use that money.
Do you feel like going swimming?
Why are you questioning me?
She said she was happy.
I'm not busy today.
He finished reading the book.
What was the name of the hotel where you stayed in Boston last year?
He contracted malaria while living in the jungle.
Tom told me not to lock the door.
He became a pianist.
My friend is beside me.
Tom never was a very good student.
I asked the stranger what his name was.
Tom has gone crazy.
She got all the more angry because I kept silent.
His aunt's apple pie was delicious and he had a second helping.
She feeds her dog the same thing that she eats.
Say please.
Life is like a roller coaster ride.
What are you hiding?
I wish you would do as you're told.
I go to Osaka by bus.
Why is she doing this?
He was conspicuous by his absence.
His car spun out of control going around the curve.
They know we're here.
The house was burned to the ground.
I would rather starve than work under him.
I always keep my word.
This is ugly.
Tom tried to stay quiet.
What kind of fool do you think I am?
I'm fairly happy.
Let's get out of here before the cops get here.
I don't understand at all.
He sat there smoking a pipe.
The dog started barking.
It was only a hypothesis.
He didn't tell me his name.
Who are you and why are you here?
Get out of this car.
It's really hard to choose the right color.
What did the boy say?
He will play baseball tomorrow.
Let's see if we can come up with a better solution.
The door would not open.
What's the horse's name?
He won the third prize.
I'm hungry now.
In 1860, Lincoln was elected President of the United States.
I shouldn't have wasted my time reading that.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
Can I have everyone's attention please?
She is a woman of great beauty.
You're not fast enough.
If you don't want to be alone, I can keep you company.
Night is when most people go to bed.
He has coached us for half a year.
I don't need an excuse.
Put it there, not here.
The only useful answers are those that raise new questions.
I think I'd like to be a teacher.
They are about the same age.
When you have a question, ask the teacher.
Comb your hair before you go out.
Did they go to the mountains?
He's going bald.
My mother is busy in the kitchen.
Be sure to drop in on us if you come our way.
The men followed him.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I know Tom better than I know you.
I didn't want to involve you.
I called your office today, but you weren't in.
My joints ache.
She is a pianist.
Don't look so suspicious.
I don't know what you really want.
In case of an earthquake, turn off the gas.
We need proof.
The book is on the table.
I'd like you to keep this a secret.
They had a heated discussion.
You don't have a clue.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
I wish we had done more.
I wonder what Tom actually thinks.
It's Tom's turn to wash the dishes.
In spite of the fact that she was busy, she came to see me.
You're enjoying yourselves, aren't you?
I do not mind what you do.
Tom washed the apple before he ate it.
I'm really proud of that.
Let me see that list.
I cried on his shoulder.
I respect your talent.
They announced that a storm was coming.
Which one's the new one?
Where do babies come from?
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
I'm going to a monster truck rally.
You're very sophisticated.
She is unable to cope with stress.
The pain is getting worse.
Please don't leave me here by myself.
What will you do?
I feel like I've been reborn.
He was voted prom king.
She hugged him.
Please wait a moment.
I thought you wouldn't mind waiting for me.
We're ambitious.
Will it rain today?
Would you mind if I kissed you?
I know what you're doing.
I never saw such a woman.
It would be nice if it stopped raining.
This is for my friend.
I live here now.
You will be paid according to your ability.
Will it rain this afternoon?
How many students are there in your university?
Tom tossed the ball to Mary.
Don't read my journal.
I think that's enough for today.
Tokyo is larger than Yokohama.
It's not safe here.
Yesterday I bought a book.
You did it in front of the staff.
I feel empowered.
Our apartment is starting to look pretty cool.
We listened to her for some time.
We're sorry we can't help you.
Tie your shoe.
We've been waiting all morning.
She is extremely attractive.
She's a fox.
Are you looking for work?
He should have known better.
Where did Tom go yesterday?
I don't really like you.
According to the contract you may take three days of bereavement leave for your uncle's funeral, but only one for your nephew's.
You can't blame him.
He's still sick in bed.
You're the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
I can't reach the ceiling.
No one will ever find you.
He was wearing a threadbare suit.
I'd like to move to the countryside.
Tom owns a very profitable company.
She has had the same boyfriend since she was eighteen.
The situation resulted in violence.
You should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive.
I still have the book from last semester.
I've been watching you study.
I can put up with a house being untidy, but I don't like it to be dirty.
Is there anything else to eat?
Don't you think most Japanese students work hard?
I hope I didn't make a fool of myself.
Pass me the salt, please.
Tie your shoe.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
Watch us.
All of us stood up.
These are my suitcases.
Where's everyone?
My room has two windows.
There's no way to tell.
I feel like someone is watching me.
I'm sensitive.
I can't read French, nor can I speak it.
Did you win the case?
Tom has a lot of problems.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Fallen rocks blocked the road.
You just have to do as you're told.
Would you like it washed?
I will visit my uncle in Kyoto this summer.
I'd forgotten that you'd forgotten.
I give you enough money every month to pay all your bills.
I think it's time to leave.
No one believes him.
I said maybe.
I thought you were serious.
You're not the only Canadian here.
I'm not an expert, so my answer to your question is just an educated guess.
We're still friends.
Where were you all night?
For the time being, my sister is an assistant in a supermarket.
Metal spoons are generally made of stainless steel.
Tom isn't paying attention.
That is my overcoat.
Who is the gentleman he is speaking to?
You're a very gifted artist.
I have more than enough.
I just decided I'd come home early.
I know a few things.
Am I included?
He acknowledged his faults.
The children were swimming naked.
You bought it from Tom, didn't you?
The roof leaks.
It is strange that you should know that.
Take off your socks.
Tom told me he wanted to meet my parents.
I see how you did that.
The house belongs to him.
How do I turn this off?
Maybe it's true.
Don't forget your water bottle.
The baby cried.
How do you come up with such interesting plots for your novels?
I'm the one who painted this picture.
The first casualty of every war is the truth.
Tie your shoe.
Where were you on the night of October 20th?
I said nothing of the sort.
He has almost no money, but he gets by.
Organic food is healthier.
He's your son.
I'm glad to see you here.
That guy is always asking his parents for money.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
We talked about everything.
Tom has a funny way of laughing, doesn't he?
Tom looked for his glasses.
It's a rainy day.
He gave her a box.
Tom doesn't have the right to say that.
Please be honest.
Far from being a failure, it was a great success.
I want to ask you a question.
Did you have fun?
Come tomorrow morning.
I understand your frustration.
This answer made him angry.
I must buy a new winter coat.
They wanted me out of the way.
He became a policeman.
He is a man of vision.
I want this cat.
I am a tourist.
You're creative.
I'm getting ready for the worst.
How long does it take to walk from here to the city hall?
She interrupted him while he was speaking.
How can this be done?
You were hot, weren't you?
Thank you for your support.
I downloaded it.
Can you tell us what Tom did?
What did you say your name was?
She lived a happy life.
This kind of cat doesn't have a tail.
If you listen closely enough you'll be able to hear it.
You can use margarine as a substitute for butter.
Your life depends on it.
She refused his offer.
You have a lot of nerve.
Anyone can produce salt from seawater with a simple experiment.
I really enjoy spending time with you.
She has a pure heart.
I'm declaring an emergency.
You were drunk last night, weren't you?
She is muttering to herself.
Could you please pull the weeds and water the flowers?
Commit these words to memory.
Is that your car in the driveway?
You did nothing wrong.
I'd prefer to be at home.
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Where do they come from?
You don't understand.
I like spending time with Tom.
You are blinded by love.
Have you finished the suggested reading?
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
There was an explosion in the lab.
She is lucky.
I want it all.
Please promise me that you'll never lie to me again.
Do you speak Esperanto?
We've run out of water.
Tom is at the neighbor's house.
This map is worthless.
When your husband finds out, he won't be happy.
This is the best cake that I have ever eaten.
Nobody lives there.
I'd like to be friends.
What do you say?
It is too late.
We shouldn't stay here.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
I'm thinking of going somewhere for a change of air, since my doctor advises me to.
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
The officer inspired his men to be brave.
This tastes good.
I know how hard this is.
Each member has to pay 10,000 yen a month.
I did what I had to.
Tom plays the trombone.
Never give up on your dreams.
It is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner.
Tom was surprised by what he saw.
That was then and this is now.
I just want you to think about it.
You are important.
He was wounded in the fight.
None of us is perfect.
Do you enjoy losing?
I love my new class.
Tom dove into the swimming pool.
Bring me the menu, please.
Could you repeat that, please?
She likes jazz, and I do, too.
Which of you will go?
We haven't come to a decision yet.
I don't feel like playing either.
Could you go to the store?
It was very hot.
He doesn't have his medication.
You don't need to tell me your real name.
I want you to be my partner.
I want to take it apart.
There was a lot of snow.
I nodded to show that I agreed.
Tom has lost his wallet.
Can I have a hug?
I figured you'd be here.
Graham Greene is one of my favorite authors.
I fall asleep easily while watching television.
Bourbon is made from corn.
I saw you there.
I don't have time to argue with you.
Why can't we do both?
The general ordered the deployment of two battalions.
You've got to go even if you don't want to.
She was the last woman that I expected to see at the party.
The lights are all off.
You're talkative.
Someone's outside.
I'm not driving anywhere.
You gotta get more organized.
I suggest we all calm down.
I don't think anyone has lived in this house for years.
She handed him his jacket then opened the door and asked him to leave.
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends.
He studied hard in order to get into college.
Give me your money.
This is no longer for sale.
Was that a no?
What's that?
Don't let this information leak out.
I want to stretch my legs.
She is different from her sister in every way.
Would you like to know how I did that?
We need to remember to put some gasoline in the car.
Would you wait a second?
That was no ordinary storm.
No one knows what happened.
The expedition's supplies soon gave out.
I asked what Tom was reading.
Don't tell anyone this.
Tom fell asleep while reading.
Do you really want Tom to do that?
It's time to eat lunch.
Am I under investigation now?
We shouldn't judge people based on their appearance.
The early bird catches the worm.
Don't try to blame this all on me.
Of course, he is right.
Is there something you're not telling us?
Let her talk.
He is a very imaginative writer.
Lake Geneva is the largest lake in Switzerland.
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing.
What a pity it is that you can't come!
Tom plugged in the TV.
I brush my teeth after eating.
I refreshed myself with a hot bath.
Your brother is very angry.
Tom handed the map to Mary.
Has the mailman already come?
Minors aren't allowed to enter.
Bring a date.
She cried all night.
I want to see your supervisor.
What are you wearing tonight?
My headache is finally gone.
What have you come here for?
It's on my desk.
I don't know what it's like yet.
I've got something to show you.
What's it used for?
I can hear Tom singing.
I wonder why he was absent.
It's your civic duty to vote.
My sister is a good swimmer.
He anonymously donated a large sum of money to the Red Cross.
The fuse has blown.
I was born in October.
You were in danger.
This showy dress isn't appropriate for me.
He could not go to college.
We've been married for 30 years.
It was a miracle.
I had a hunch you would do that.
Wait for your turn, please.
They are leaving Japan tomorrow.
You're horrible.
We rested for a while.
Check that.
While I was swimming, I got a cramp in my leg.
Welcome to San Francisco.
She believes her son is still alive.
I can't believe I finally managed to meet you.
I just want to let you know that I can't attend this afternoon's meeting.
I wasn't complaining about that.
Hang on.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I'm slow to adapt to new situations.
One thing I've always wanted to do is get a decent job close to home.
I like coffee better than tea.
So, what is it you want me to say?
Stop arguing.
I'm studying English.
How are you going to handle this?
I didn't want to believe it myself.
You ought to know better at your age.
It's very humid.
No one believed me.
We decided to lie hidden for a few days.
Get lost!
You're very open.
He pretended that he was a lawyer.
I don't believe it!
What languages do you know?
My father complained about the traffic noise.
I know you did it.
I went to the bank to take out money.
They met on a blind date.
They might pay me more if I could use a computer.
You must do as I say.
The boat drifted out to sea.
How tall you are!
It came apart.
I remember the event as vividly as if it were just yesterday.
You're off the hook.
I hit the snooze button and went back to sleep.
Is that you?
He may have missed the train.
We overslept.
He is accustomed to working hard.
He stood up and took a deep breath.
Don't just stand there, say something.
I'll finish it in one hour.
Students should try not to be late.
He has made the company what it is today.
I've taken care of it.
I realize it's hard to believe.
I opened a bottle of red wine.
Why don't you come in?
They were disappointed that you could not come.
The teapot is whistling.
I usually go to bed at ten.
Everything happened at lightning speed.
Have you already met her?
Let's keep in touch with each other.
He thought of a good solution.
I might have to get my tonsils out.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
Their feet are dirty.
You're welcome to come with us if you want to.
We're going the wrong way.
You should have told him.
I brought some friends with me.
Come and get it.
Who is this boy?
Why didn't you listen to your father?
The man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital.
I saw you there.
I wonder why women outlive men.
I let my friend copy my homework.
I know you're not comfortable.
I'll never forget going to Hawaii with her.
What are you eating right now?
We want one.
Please keep in touch.
The roses are in bloom in our garden.
Football is my favorite game.
Why are you staring at me like that?
I had a stroke last year.
The station is situated in between the two towns.
I'm delighted to be here.
I found the picture you were looking for.
I wish you were wrong, but I know that you're right.
We ran off 50 copies of the invitation.
She has marginalized herself.
I'd like to go out with you.
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours.
Was that you at the door?
This is not what we want.
Frictions between Japan and the U.S. are easing up for a change.
He grows a mustache.
You missed a spot.
How does it feel to be back?
I'll step outside.
I think you should choose Tom.
Can you walk on stilts?
Don't be so outraged.
I really thought I could do it.
I don't remember it.
Is your mother at home?
That's probably safer.
That's a controversial theory.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Give me another couple of days to think it over.
We took turns cleaning the room.
I broke it.
I have nothing further to say.
The day was exhausting.
The police want to question you.
At last, they came to a decision.
You can do it if you put your mind to it.
You have no evidence.
What kind of fruit do you want?
You are old enough to know better than to act like that.
I'd better not eat that.
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
I didn't want it to happen.
She'd like him to leave right away.
I don't believe it.
You must not touch the paintings.
You're awesome.
He hurt himself when he fell.
It is pretty cold today.
My shoelace got caught in the escalator.
She taught him how to play the piano.
What were you thinking about?
I just don't want any of these.
They are alone.
Everyone knows that I don't like Tom.
I was meaning to call you.
Tom was a brave soldier.
This instant soup comes in individual packets.
My father tried to teach us the value of work.
She was in a hurry to go home.
I'm glad to finally meet you.
What did you eat for breakfast?
I'm not saying that's wrong.
I was unconscious.
Are you finished?
He tricked me.
The escalator suddenly stopped.
I held his sleeve.
Tom's dog is very big.
Tom bought a parrot.
Business is quite slow.
I had to work on an essay.
What's the golden rule?
Did you pick up on that strange tone in his voice?
Are you actually serious?
The subway entrance is on the corner.
You must tell me.
You can't do it by yourself.
If two people are in agreement, one of them is unnecessary.
I think I will take a vacation this week.
Keep searching.
He couldn't hold back his tears.
I want to visit Korea.
It'll be hard to persuade Tom.
She and I usually agree.
I got you all right where I want you.
I've become friends with Tom.
He seems happy.
I had my hat blown off by the wind.
The station is in the center of the city.
I bought it in a thrift store.
If that were true, what would you do?
What he's doing is driving me mad.
I want to go to Mars.
Should you always freeze fresh meat?
They have been busy.
I walked in the woods by myself.
Where are your children?
Where did you learn to dance like this?
Why don't you sing for us?
She has gone shopping.
Would you like to have a look?
The man must be insane.
Do you have a family?
Don't forget to write me.
They really slept on the floor.
Tell Tom that everyone is here.
I did what I had to do.
That's not very nice.
Nobody must know.
Why don't you run for president?
I think Tom should give Mary another chance.
He gave his children a good education.
I should've expected it.
You're very stylish.
Tom died in prison.
You're very emotional.
Do you know any good places to eat around here?
We would like to leave.
Do we have a deal here?
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.
I met him by accident at the airport yesterday.
He rarely goes to the movies.
He didn't do it on purpose.
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
He has enough willpower.
Do you want me to explain it again?
Who gave you this?
Don't forget to floss.
I could not catch as many fish as I had expected.
What is it you want to talk about?
We must talk her out of this foolish plan.
I left my key in my room.
Whose shoes are these?
I am sure I met him somewhere, but I do not remember who he is.
That's very odd.
When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere.
She is my classmate.
How long have you been a doctor here?
How good are you?
Italian isn't difficult.
Look at me when I talk to you!
You're in pain, aren't you?
Japan is one of the greatest economic powers in the world.
We'll never get through it.
A woman fell from a ship into the sea.
Do you have health insurance?
What does it contain?
Don't hesitate to ask for advice.
You will find the restaurant on your right.
Tom wrote a lot of letters to Mary.
That university was my first choice.
We're leaving tonight.
Are you hurt?
You can wait for me here.
He was not at all satisfied.
Will there be anything else?
I think friends are important.
She has been unhappy since her cat died.
Be careful. This knife is really sharp.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
I'll be there in a sec.
I'm on my lunch break.
I shouldn't have eaten that. I feel sick.
Tom was surprised how well Mary could play the saxophone.
His bag was stolen yesterday.
He left the box unprotected.
Make a guess.
Little remains to be done.
It was rather difficult for me to make out what he was saying.
She advised him to work harder.
We didn't intend to attack him.
These shoes are hers.
I may be able to come to your office Monday afternoon.
For here, or to go?
I want you to lay back and relax.
She made him a new suit.
Just water, please.
Can a case be made for late-term abortions?
Tom is dead.
Above all, watch your diet.
The issue is quite familiar to us.
Any questions?
It's all gone.
Tom didn't want to play golf with Mary's father.
I was born here.
Even though I ate three bowls of cereal for breakfast, I'm still hungry.
I'll take one.
Tomorrow, I'll take the books to the library.
I don't have anything to do right now.
I bought it yesterday.
Tom didn't get very far.
He became a national hero.
I am in charge of the third-year class.
A small car is more economical than a large one.
Why didn't I think of that?
She is wearing a brooch.
What's the fastest way to get there from here?
I opened the drawer to get a pencil.
I wonder what could have made him change his mind.
Did you hurt yourself?
He's very proud of his custom motorcycle.
When was the last time you slept in this room?
I cut myself.
Nowadays anybody can get books.
He must be crazy to treat his parents like this.
You're faithful.
What is all this stuff?
I can't help but laugh when I think about that.
I should've taken an umbrella with me.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
He put aside a few dollars each week.
I picked the lock.
He is teaching me.
I can't sleep.
He is working hard to pass the examination.
Are you hiring?
The weather forecast is not reliable at all.
You're very rude.
He denied having said such a thing.
I live in Tokyo.
He is full of new ideas.
Maybe we can fix this.
I really am glad you're here.
Eat something.
His helplessness appeals to her motherly sympathy.
The old woman is a doctor.
He calculated the expenses.
Hurry up.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
I want a hot shower before I go back to work.
Everything is going to be different now.
This city is 1,600 meters above sea level.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow?
This guy is great.
I don't need to go to the doctor.
They cut my hair too short.
I almost forgot all about that.
She wrote him a long letter, but she didn't mail it.
Nobody was interested.
They say that old house is haunted.
They had been thinking about it for some time.
I have to make sure everything is OK.
The lubrication system was poorly designed.

If you need a ride, I could come and get you.
Are you still interested?
How old do you think she is?
Don't rely on others.
He speaks French fluently.
We are apt to make mistakes.
Did you have any trouble?
Did I get it right?
Tom wants to be a stuntman.
Everybody in the village looks up to him.
I'm not one of them.
What do you think is going to happen?
I'm inviting you.
All right, listen carefully.
Call 1-800-828-6322 for a free brochure.
I'm not a liar.
She advised him to go to the police station, but he was afraid to.
I've asked you this question before.
What did you do today?
She put on her sweater.
How is your family?
Do you have anything hot to drink?
He's scared to talk to me.
There are many people living in this house.
I didn't take it that seriously.
I'm a child.
You party too much.
Are you sure they can do this?
We can't give up.
Tom doesn't like poker at all.
You ought to have told me that before.
Get on your knees.
Was that a squirrel?
Tom has money. However, he's not all that happy.
You need to lose weight.
Where are they going to?
He explained to my son why it rains.
You can't go yet.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
The bank had the gall to charge a late fee for a payment held up when their online services crashed.
Are you happy with your weight?
We have to split.
He's a bartender.
Can you give me your phone number?
I run my own business.
I haven't talked to Tom.
He doesn't understand me.
What are some foods you usually eat with a knife and fork?
How many times did you do that?
She knelt beside him and asked him what his name was.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I could hear everything.
I can't remember anything about that night.
I left my umbrella at home.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
I opened the door and saw two boys standing side by side.
Are you on Facebook?
Tom is taller than any of the other kids in his class.
How tall you are!
Could you explain to me why you think these rules don't apply anymore?
I'm no longer hungry.
We debated the problem.
Would you care for a little wine?
You're not listening, are you?
I feel sorry for her.
Why would I want to sue you?
It's a weapon.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted him to walk her home.
Who has come?
Do you want to go get a drink?
Four is an unlucky number in Japanese.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
Open your mouth and close your eyes.
She is good at skiing.
He attached great importance to the event.
A good team is a group of individuals who work together to achieve a common goal.
They don't need to do it right away.
He told me about it.
I want to help Tom as much as I can.
Tom sipped some tea.
The coach gave me some advice.
Of course, I don't need it.
I'm not the boss.
You should take care of your sick mother.
It isn't safe for us to remain in this area.
I had never seen her.
I saw Tom take your keys.
Look out for pickpockets.
You will always be there.
Tom and Mary don't really have much in common.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Tom's diet resulted in weight loss.
The man lost all hope.
Let Tom do his job.
He is stronger than ever.
The older children helped the younger ones.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
My wife is a good manager.
Excuse me, what's the shortest route to the station?
I love all of you.
I can't let you.
I tried to cheer him up.
I don't really like horses.
She stayed here by herself.
Why didn't you wait for me?
I want to get on with my life.
Don't come to me now with that. You should have said something when it originally happened.
I knew there would be trouble when Tom walked into the room.
We'll think about it in due time.
Are you sure?
Do you have a question?
I'd never seen anything like it.
She was about to call him up when he walked in the door.
You know very well what Tom wants.
He repaired his watch by himself.
What are you getting so upset about?
I escaped death.
I'm glad you're here.
Explain what that means.
What he said is a good idea.
Father took his place at the head of the table.
As far as I know, he has never come on time.
Chances are the bill will be rejected.
I just got your message.
I shouldn't have stayed up late yesterday.
You're wasting my time.
I brought you some water.
I'm just worried about my weight.
He made me go.
I oppose it.
She is learning how to drive a car.
I read the report you wrote.
I'm feeling sort of tired.
Tom often tells jokes.
I don't like this.
I advised him not to drive.
I think we did a very good job.
How did you come by all this money?
Tom has a point here.
Are you Tom?
I'd like to talk about your situation.
We're prisoners.
I know other people like Tom.
How many people are in your crew?
We opened this store in 2013.
You're worried, aren't you?
Nice timing.
I am not like you.
There were no survivors.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
Tom said he enjoyed the show.
That's all I have to know.
Both sisters are very beautiful.
To tell the truth, I felt lonely.
You worry about your weight too much.
The meeting was just about over.
They haven't changed their mind.
The noise will wake the baby up.
He gladly accepted our offer.
Contact my assistant if you have any questions.
It'll cost over a thousand yen.
She is singing the latest popular songs.
Tom will spend the rest of his life in prison.
Do you know how old I am?
It's too bad she can't come to the party.
That's doubtful.
He left after he had lunch.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
I like playing baseball.
Tom is never on time.
I'm sure that he's happy.
I asked him to lend me some money.
Everyone was alert.
I'll be the last one to do that.
The fence was not high enough to keep the wolves out.
Please have a seat.
Why do you want to commit suicide?
We can't go.
Tom told me he was unlucky.
There's a catch.
A man is more or less what he looks like.
A lot of wild animals died because there wasn't any food.
I can't make it any clearer.
You're not a millionaire.
The basket was empty.
She was having a hard time swimming.
Why are you saying goodbye?
The water turned to ice.
She has a small black dog.
No one was helping us.
It all depends how you handle it.
Who are you to tell me what to do?
They never tell a lie.
Meditation doesn't cost anything, but it takes time.
Tell me where you went.
A mirror reflects light.
I always end up looking up the same words in the dictionary.
He wrote to me from time to time.
I'm still a little hungry.
I'd have waited for you.
I am just a humble teacher.
Democracy is an idea that goes back to the ancient Greeks.
Despair drove him to attempt suicide.
The fruit went bad.
Your mother is going to kill me.
Did you see the eclipse yesterday?
What would the world be without women?
I don't remember that guy's name.
She gained weight.
Try not to laugh.
I participated in the discussion.
What does this word mean?
I always have a couple of beach towels in my car.
You have got to be kidding.
I didn't see you until now.
Our friendship did not last.
They had no alternative energy sources.
What did Tom get you for Christmas?
He played the guitar and she played the piano.
They're almost here.
I wasn't born rich.
It would be nice if you helped me a little.
Even though he was tired, he went on with his work.
At times, I can't trust him.
My mother likes tea very much.
She is frightened of thunder.
Tom made a costly mistake.
Did you see that?
How did you get into my house?
You must see to it that the cakes do not burn.
I translated everything Tom wrote into French.
You are watching TV all the time.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
We'd like a double room with bath.
I thought you might want to come along.
There's one problem with this.
He doesn't know what it is to be poor.
Where are your kids?
Sometimes things that happen do not make sense.
The tank is full.
I don't want to talk anymore.
Is this seat vacant?
You're very tall.
She is certain to pass the exam.
I was trying to reach you.
I advised Tom not to do that.
You must be very hungry now.
She's the girl of my dreams.
I'll be right there.
Is that depressing?
Someone stole my bicycle.
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
Tom used to be my boyfriend.
I cut across the park.
The enemy is weak.
A trip to America is out of the question.
She hardly talks at all.
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
Please speak French.
I have no way of knowing that.
Tom is a lot shorter than Mary.
They stood up for what was right.
Are you sure you're not tired?
I don't want you to think I'm nuts.
Let's not discuss the matter today.
We had an unpleasant experience there.
Tom drinks at least three liters of water every day.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
Don't you want to be in love again?
We could sing together.
Tom loves watching Mary dance.
How much longer do you suggest we devote to this?
We have a meeting.
They say that I'm an old woman.
You didn't make it clear.
The Chinese are a hard-working people.
They were frustrated.
We can't escape.
I want more information.
I play the piano.
Do not come here.
Someone took my stuff.
Trust Tom.
I guess you're right about that.
You don't have to be so rude.
I don't think I can do that.
You cannot read this novel without crying.
He went to France to brush up on his speaking ability.
Tom died at 65.
You'd better go home as soon as possible.
He was wrong.
It was like something out of a movie.
I only saw him once.
He held her tightly.
He is late.
I disobeyed you.
You don't know the truth.
They explored every avenue in an attempt to avoid war.
He had his car stolen in that parking lot.
I want to have a word with Tom.
I'm not uncomfortable.
Would you draw me a map?
We hope that you understand the difficult situation with which we are confronted.
Do I annoy you?
I don't want to talk to you about this.
I took it for granted that you were on our side.
I'll buy a Ford.
I'd rather stay at home than go fishing.
Don't try this at home.
He went out in spite of the rain.
Some people believe in God and other people don't.
I'm younger than I look.
Some non-native speakers think they speak the language better than native speakers.
I thought you didn't like romance movies.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
Some large birds prey upon small birds and animals.
I never saw you.
When can we eat?
How did you get into my house?
What time do you wake up?
I'm not ugly.
The book is on the table.
She wouldn't let him in the room no matter what.
Keep on smiling.
They're all against me.
There will be an energy crisis in the near future.
Aren't you embarrassed?
Tom isn't very tall, is he?
Where does this train go?
Tom has a sister.
Will surgery help it?
I'll be happy to help you.
She is going on 35.
Never choose a vocation just because it promises social standing.
What would you like me to do?
I really like being with you.
What's the difference between a star and a planet?
She passed the examination with ease.
I don't remember where I put my key.
We can't tow this car.
We have no secrets from each other.
He's a jerk.
It was a busy day.
He was stoned.
You came too late.
Do you like to be alone?
Hurry up, and you'll catch the train.
Neither of them looks busy.
I'm the spokesperson for this organization.
They can't fire you.
It really is difficult.
There is a marked difference between them.
Tell me how I can help you.
She is habitually late.
The council agreed on it.
It was on the morning of February the ninth that I arrived in London.
I'll take that into consideration.
She told him that she didn't love him.
I want you to be my coach.
Have you ever sold a car?
Your French is good.
You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.
There is a lot of furniture in this room.
You've been had.
I don't particularly want to be here at all.
In the year 2012, there will be flying cars everywhere.
Don't play with fire.
I'm a really bad dancer.
He lives on his country estate.
While waiting for bus, I was caught in a shower.
Is this your room?
Take Tom outside.
The plans for the offensive were secret.
You want something from me, don't you?
Tom was given a medal.
The President is usually accompanied by his wife when he goes abroad.
That doesn't add up.
Don't forget that.
He felt perfectly content.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
This park is a paradise for children.
His fake moustache started to peel off on one side.
You're turning thirty.
The curtain caught on fire.
I appreciate you coming here.
I suggested that the meeting be put off.
I am going to sleep.
I'm not taking no for an answer.
We saw Tom talking to Mary in the park this morning.
She hired him as an interpreter.
How can it be?
If I'd only read the contract more carefully!
Whether you believe it or not, I believe it.
Please sign here.
We're not allowed to do that.
Not everybody succeeds in life.
Do you want some coffee?
I think you should see this.
I don't like chocolate.
Environmental changes gave rise to new species.
My dog is dreaming of a cat.
Can you imagine him driving such a splendid car?
You can't cling to the past.
Tom was getting agitated.
Put some clothes on.
Dissolve the tablet in a glass of water.
This summer we had an unusual amount of rain.
I thought I was alone here.
I hope all but one of your dreams come true, so you always have something to strive for.
I love fried bananas.
I go to bed very early.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
It is true in a sense.
I suppose that's OK.
My nickname is "Itch."
Shut the door, please.
The train was due at six.
A ball hit her right leg.
Do you take American Express?
It will not happen again.
We got involved in a traffic accident.
She loves Tom more than she loves me.
My husband always reads in bed.
I didn't want anyone to know I was here.
Lesson Three is hard.
My phone was out of order.
Did he stay very long?
Tom is a football player.
It may be the last time.
I don't want you two talking about me.
I'll be happy to work with you.
I told you to call me.
He's known for that.
You're stupid.
I want them to be your friends.
You are tired, aren't you?
No one is home.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
You won't need me.
I lit the candle.
He tried with all his might to push the door open.
It poured for three days.
Come over for dinner sometime.
They found the room empty.
Don't smoke.
Let's not deviate from the subject.
Can you at least try?
The same thing applies to me.
I'm shorter than him.
That's why I sent for you.
I want you to handle this.
Why come to me now?
What's the new guy's name?
Seen from the sky, the river looked like a huge snake.
Do you think it's wise to wear your uniform today?
I want you to talk.
It's just pepper spray.
I have no idea why it is so.
I will do it by all means.
This is a very scary moment.
You look young for your age.
Is this your letter?
When did you tell me that?
Tom was probably born in Boston.
She asked him if he knew where I lived.
They are all very busy.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Prices have reached a 13-year high.
I don't think I can help you.
The ground was very rocky.
Why don't you have a party?
Are you sure?
I should be studying English, but I'd rather watch a movie.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
They just want someone to blame.
I think you're too picky.
Don't go out after dark.
We're expecting a good harvest this year.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow.
What's the matter with you?
The sky was completely dark.
You're fascinating.
They seem to have had a good time in Rome.
I'm fine.
I owe my success to you.
I'll start.
What's it look like?
You're always singing.
How long have you been busy?
I don't want either of them.
You can't believe everything you hear.
I just assumed you'd be here.
Tom encouraged Mary.
Tom won't answer the question.
They're expensive.
You heard your mother.
I have one thousand dollars in travelers' checks and five hundred in cash.
The crowd is growing larger and larger.
At the best hotels, there is always someone at your beck and call.
I'm not stupid enough to lend him money.
He doesn't like the heat of the summer.
He won a gold medal.
Are you saying that's not true?
Is there any way you can un-shrink a T-shirt that has shrunk?
Maybe that'll be enough.
I opened the box and looked inside.
Tom had a difficult job.
You're not allowed to eat those.
It was that dog that bit my hand.
After hearing the sad news, she broke down in tears.
Don't let me catch you doing anything like this again.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
Just a few days ago, we were so happy.
I'm not going outside.
I'm not comfortable with this.
You can't believe that.
I didn't want to intrude.
I think you'd better come back home.
I felt reborn.
We are not alone.
That's so ironic.
I can scarcely sleep at night.
I'd like to go somewhere else now.
By the way, have you heard from her since then?
I've been painting the ceiling.
I'm glad to hear that.
She has not come here yet.
You tried to stop Tom from doing that, didn't you?
It was a fine day so I went on a picnic.
It's time for us to do something about that.
I think you should think about the future.
I can't eat fruit in the morning.
I had quite a busy day today.
The big fire reduced the whole town to ashes.
I like French food very much.
He will never make it.
I know your roommate.
I had such high hopes for you.
You can't bury your head in the sand.
They've crossed the border.
She is a student who studies very hard.
We're almost like brothers.
Was she able to write a report?
Are you saying my life is in danger?
Don't go in that building.
Come down from the tree.
All aboard!
His face turned pale.
I have something to ask of you.
Why do you spend so much time watching TV?
He gave me what little money he had.
Have you ever been lonely?
I watched TV for two hours yesterday.
You never get my jokes.
I'd like a cup of tea, please.
I will get in touch with you.
Tom knew he needed to leave town.
I fell in love in an unlikely place.
That's not all that happened.
This is yours.
Where did you go to school?
How much time does the average teenager watch TV every day?
This is the boy.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
The rent is paid for six months.
I'll leave it up to you.
I've never stolen anything from Tom.
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other.
I'd like to give you something.
I have other plans for you.
How old were you when your family moved to Boston?
Don't forget to write to us.
The exam was very difficult.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
Tom goes to bed at the same time every night.
They should have one.
I want you to go see the nurse.
You'll find out soon enough.
Plants grow.
I'm innocent.
Tom looks disgusted.
Did you solve the problem?
Tom likes animals.
We spent the afternoon cleaning our gear.
Let's quit talking about this.
He trusted you.
I have a new red car.
I don't have vodka.
You should be real proud of yourself.
Men, dogs, fish, and birds are all animals.
Years passed.
Let's go grab a burger or something.
He wants to go to America.
Those who want to remain may do so.
Do you know what Tom does in his free time?
Do you feel sick?
How old is this stuff?
Tom can't help you now.
I can't talk about that.
I wanted to read a book.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
I don't want your job.
You may kiss me if you like.
They were seen to go out.
His office is very close to mine.
Do you know how to speak English?
I want you to go upstairs.
Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution.
They are the ones who want to go.
I just want to keep things nice and simple.
He exposed himself to danger.
Nothing ever happens in this old village.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
It is a very strange letter.
What have we gotten into?
I've warned you before about this.
They shouldn't be doing that.
Where were you last night?
You probably don't want to talk to me.
My dog is pregnant.
He won't call this evening.
Please wait outside the house.
Tom could do everything by himself.
I have another idea.
I was sleepy.
They made Tom an offer.
Where's the light switch?
People came to like her paintings.
Why are you jealous of me?
He is speaking English.
The dog is sleeping.
How many times have I told you to fold your clothes?
Don't play with fire.
You'd better go home at once.
I have an appointment I don't want to be late for.
What were you hoping to see?
Lend me your book, please.
I heard you made a big mistake today.
I had to shoot my horse because he was in a lot of pain.
What's your last name?
The north wind blew all day.
That happens to us a lot.
Return immediately.
You look upset.
She is a doctor.
I want you to return to your seat.
Every house had a garden.
How do we stop Tom?
I have a good appetite today.
Thanks for the drink.
I could use a little sleep.
I've got to see a dentist.
I feel fine.
When are you going to move?
She parted from her friend in tears.
She was blackmailed by him.
No sooner had she caught sight of me than she started running in my direction.
I hear what you're saying.
You don't need a list.
She was advised by him to go abroad while she was still young.
My mother didn't mention it.
This is tricky.
Turn left at the second traffic light.
Stand up straight.
His advice didn't help much.
I worked on a farm.
We want to negotiate.
She talks as if she knew everything.
You ought to have taken your father's advice.
She fixed us a snack.
I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
Don't make me go back there.
Maybe you should just leave Tom alone.
The crew abandoned the ship.
You don't scare me.
No one can say.
Do you have a hunting license?
You heard correctly.
I'm going to be a teacher.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
Here is a letter for you.
I thought he was honest.
He has a pleasant voice.
Who are you?
She begged him to send her home.
My grandfather on my mother's side passed away ten years ago.
I'm not interested in your problems.
What's going on out here?
I must help you.
We've been warned.
From space, the earth looks quite small.
We're studying French and web design.
You're careful.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
Driving relaxes me.
She advised him to study harder.
I don't know how to say goodbye in French.
Tom swims better than I do.
Small businesses are often absorbed by a major company.
He never tells a lie.
I know what they mean.
I'm not sure I like this.
Do as you want.
The earliest civilizations arose in Mesopotamia.
He has a maid.
Do you know me?
What did you do to it?
That was easier than I thought.
She goes to the beauty salon at least once a week.
I know Tom wanted to meet you.
That's why I have to do this.
Why are we poor?
We heard a gunshot.
Is anyone else bidding?
Cookie's mother died of cancer.
He loves you very much.
The governor ordered an investigation.
You don't have to do what Tom says.
Shake my hand.
This isn't my money.
She did not listen.
The students disobeyed their teacher.
Who is he talking to?
The plane took off at 2:30.
Don't blame the victim.
Don't panic!
He came to Tokyo in search of employment.
The teacher told him not to forget his books.
I am fat.
Don't you want to meet Tom?
Why don't you go ahead?
Tom has great wealth, but he is not happy.
I remember everything you tell me.
Why on earth do you want to know that?
She just left.
I tried, but I did not succeed.
They enjoy one another's company.
I saw Tom take your keys.
You are lying.
Some of us might be willing to go.
You made an error.
I don't know what you're so worried about.
My friends stood by me during the court case.
Can I see this one?
He ran to the station and caught the train.
We spent our holiday exploring rural France.
Can you tell me why you like him?
I'm a happy man.
Deal us the cards.
He has no right to do this.
She took two weeks' leave and visited China.
They were naive.
Stay a moment.
Can you guess the price?
Please keep this a secret.
Tom returned from the kitchen with two mugs of coffee and sat down next to Mary.
I'd like to talk to you.
Our education system needs to be seriously revamped.
Do you have something for me?
He is in Tokyo.
Tom didn't know what else to say.
Don't ask me to do this.
Keep your hands up.
Who says it isn't fixed?
It's been a long time since I've written anyone a letter.
I can't believe that you enjoyed that movie.
Tom wants Mary's approval.
I use this.
It's sometimes difficult to control our feelings.
I can't wait to go on a vacation.
I think that I should organize a little party.
I thought things would get better, but as it is, they are getting worse.
He has a beautiful daughter.
Is he just a one-trick pony?
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
I think I'm right.
We arrived first.
I figured it out by myself.
Take a look.
I want to thank everyone who helped me do this.
I love the way Tom does that.
It was getting dark, and, what made matters worse, it began to rain.
I'll never forget what you told me.
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
She stayed in that area for a short while.
You aren't going to call my parents, are you?
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
Are you with the FBI?
I'll meet up with you later.
My father doesn't like football.
He’s shivering because of the cold.
I don't know anything about what happened.
I paid attention.
Is it your helicopter?
It'll be tricky.
I usually walk.
I had to act quickly.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
He doesn't know where he should be.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Are you interested in Japanese music?
He looks to his uncle for advice whenever he is in trouble.
Who is your teacher?
This knife was very useful to me.
He suddenly fell ill.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
The medicine worked marvels.
Let's drop by his house.
His sons do as they please.
He got the first prize in the contest.
He quit school last week.
It was very cold.
A friend told me that story.
It makes me really happy that you're here.
I like music.
Today was a tough day.
Do you mind if I sit here?
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
Do you have anything to eat?
Tom went to sleep three hours ago.
I was too stunned to talk.
The house has burnt down.
Can you help me on this one?
I bought this racket two months ago.
Are you registered?
How old were you when you started studying French?
Mary looks like her mother.
We'd make a perfect team.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
Don't be upset.
Would that make you happy?
How much farther do we have to go?
He missed the deadline.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
He likes to play rough.
Have you already eaten?
They had no food.
You should stay away from Tom.
Give me a break.
She's strong-willed.
Are you mentally ill?
The clouds are getting darker.
I've got to learn some new songs.
Please sit down.
How fast does this car go?
What happens after that?
I left home early so I wouldn't miss the train.
Your parents can't keep us apart forever.
Will she get well soon?
Christmas is just around the corner.
I will tell her what to say at the meeting.
It is now necessary to add another rule.
I don't know what to do from now on.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
I want to go out with you.
Business is looking up.
How come Mary is going on a picnic with him?
He himself did it.
Have you got it yet?
Do you know why I was in prison?
I promise you I won't ever leave you.
Tom plays tennis.
Strive to be happy.
I shouldn't have to ever come back here.
I'll have what he's having.
Whose paper is this?
I'm taking a vacation.
From the buyer's point of view, the prices of these CD players are too high.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom is lying ill in bed.
I wish I could go back in time.
He seldom comes to see me.
Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything.
There's no air on the moon.
Tom only knows how to speak French.
Trust me.
He died before I arrived.
Can you believe this is already happening?
The contract expires next year.
What can you teach me?
You're not the only Canadian here.
He's addicted.
Is this the reason you didn't want me to come?
You still haven't told me what your phone number is.
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
Her home is in the suburbs.
He should have known better.
They ate and drank wine.
I like their pictures.
We should wait a little.
Luckily, he won the championship.
I must go.
We made a bargain.
You'll have to ask someone else.
I'm going to take some pictures.
He had been walking for hours.
You're the one who trained me.
Bad news travels quickly.
I think I'll stay at home.
All three of us are students.
Can you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?
I won't give them to you.
I love being alone.
You really don't have a clue, do you?
Don't you remember my name?
Do you think it's wise to wear your uniform today?
I bought a pair of scissors.
Can you tell me who they are?
Doctors should keep abreast with all the latest developments in medicine.
If it had not been for your raincoat, I would have been drenched to the skin.
If Tom hadn't invited me, I wouldn't have come.
We're busy.
He is thirty years old.
I've come this far, so I'll keep going.
Do you have time?
Your parents were right.
Don't tell anyone.
I could intervene.
Turn off the light.
Hey, don't do that!
He is a very careful driver.
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
When did you start wearing contacts?
I've just finished lunch.
Let us know if you're available next week.
We bought a round table.
My father always speaks in a very loud voice.
I don't know if it's what he wants.
English is spoken in Canada.
The coat is not mine.
I heard you bought a boat.
I'm sorry, Tom, I can't do that.
I promise you I'll come early.
You're a very lucky man.
I really don't want to talk about it.
I want answers to my questions.
I hate these new boots.
The majority of those men worked in the mine.
This is the monsoon season.
That movie star has many fans.
I read the novel in three days.
Fewer young people know how to write in longhand.
After hearing the tragic news, he went outside to be alone.
You look Japanese.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Did you have fun?
I certainly have had great luck.
Who's going to drive me to the airport?
He borrowed the car from his friend.
There is no other choice.
I will teach you.
"Will you have another slice of pie?" "Yes, please."
Can you tell right from wrong?
She advised him to give up drinking.
She has no fear.
That's why no one wants to work with you.
Is it far?
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
The child talks as if he were a man.
You did that.
They made the right choice.
They finished their meal.
I think he is something of a poet.
I love it.
Tom didn't have enough experience in dealing with that kind of problem.
That should please everyone.
Tom is patient, isn't he?
I found this column interesting.
What kind of man was he?
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.
The sooner you leave, the better.
I think you should ask Tom.
I have difficulty chewing.
I'm introverted.
Can anyone here speak French?
I don't want to meet your parents.
The outside of the castle was painted white.
I appreciate your vigilance.
Tom has written a book.
Just relax a moment.
I hear she's a famous actress.
I spent hours reading books.
Which of the composers do you like best?
What are you afraid of?
I thought I was cool.
I can still hear you.
I was just in time for the last train.
Are you watching carefully?
I had a bad stomachache.
He lives in Kyoto.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
I love her so much I could die.
I'd like to be more like you.
Does that trouble you?
Is that a new jacket?
Did you go out?
What a heavy bag!
This is a friend of mine.
"Is there a book on the chair?" "Yes, there is."
You understand me.
Maybe she forgot my birthday.
We're getting nowhere with those problems.
She was more beautiful than all the others.
Did you come here by yourself?
I want your opinion.
I think it's time for me to spend a little time with my children.
I'll be free next Sunday.
I will do anything but that.
My university has a dormitory.
I didn't like that.
I just got bitten by a mosquito.
It was foolish of him to waste his money on such trifles.
Computers save us a lot of time and trouble.
My house is only a mile from here.
He helped me carry the chair.
Tom wants to talk.
Sugar is bad for your teeth.
That's what I'd like to know.
Quit behaving like a kid.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
She urged him to study harder.
It's a fad.
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
Tom is interested in mountaineering.
Did you buy the medicine?
I can't believe you're talking to me like this.
What's your problem?
Tom stopped me from leaving the classroom.
We receive many telephone calls from abroad.
Do you still have feelings for him?
He has nothing to complain about.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
I think I did well.
My favorite color is blue.
Why were you late this morning?
Tom has told us a lot about you.
I have some very sad news.
That sounds like a train.
She doesn't have many friends in this town.
I'll say it one more time.
I'm a quick learner.
Organic food is usually more expensive.
Enjoy your day.
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
Get me something to eat.
I was naive.
They accused the president of not caring about the common man.
Perhaps we will see each other again tonight.
Hey. What's going on?
I've warned you before about this.
I'd like to ask you a question, but if this is a bad time, I can come back at another time.
It does seem like an excellent plan.
I do have one request.
You're nice.
You were bluffing, weren't you?
I was your babysitter when you were a kid.
This costs too much.
I have the invoice.
I think you should quit.
Her mother became mad at us.
They adopted the orphan.
I was wrong about that.
Bees fly from flower to flower.
Of course, I'll marry you.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
Is that a possibility?
I came here to save you.
She was brought up by her grandmother.
She availed herself of every opportunity to improve her English.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
I've got a cold.
The snow prevented us from arriving on time.
I wouldn't mind doing it again.
They found us.
You don't really want that, do you?
You're doing the right thing.
The days are getting warmer and warmer.
Don't say that.
Tom was charged with drunken driving after he was involved in a car accident in Boston.
Tom has nobody to help him.
You may go at once.
He likes to travel abroad.
At the beginning, I couldn't understand it.
Are you almost finished?
I felt like I would die.
She showed me her album.
Attach labels to all the bags.
He gorged himself on ice cream.
I'm just doing my job.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
Can I tell you something very personal?
I'm fat.
Have you tried that before?
There were no survivors.
As the date of the wedding approached, Tom started having second-thoughts.
We went due north.
Tom and I are friends.
She took advantage of her paid vacation and went skiing.
I lack imagination.
Thanks for the tea.
I belong to the karate club.
What did you do at school today?
What do you learn English for?
I don't suppose anything will happen.
I want to take another look around.
I do not feel like doing it.
They were punished for their crimes.
Be careful.
He painted a dog.
We're halfway home.
Are you sure he can do this?
We have lost a battle, but we will win the war.
He came to Japan when he was a boy of ten.
I thrust my hand into my pocket.
It was his car, not mine, that broke down yesterday.
I put it here somewhere.
Tom is a perfect stranger to me.
I have fewer books than you.
I have nothing left to say.
I truly loved her.
We've already tried.
No problem!
I'm practising judo.
Are you finished reading the newspaper?
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
Where did they go?
You're very tall.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
I sometimes dream of my mother.
I finished my math homework.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
You should apologize for your rudeness.
Is it possible to drink salt water?
That small star is brightest.
May I see you in private?
I thought a walk in the park might take our minds off our troubles.
I thought I got it all.
What is the purpose of the stock market?
It cost a lot of money to repair the car.
He drank a little.
I can't find it.
Why don't you stay here?
I think that would be best.
I felt relieved when my plane landed safely.
I figured you weren't coming.
I was never a very good athlete.
Is it to go?
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
You should do that now.
Do you want to join them?
You'll get into trouble.
Her oldest son is not married.
I have plenty of things to eat in the pantry.
She accused me of making a mistake.
Let me do that.
The streets are flooded.
Am I interrupting something here?
We're not ready to do that.
How deep is it here?
You should exercise more.
I was told to contact you.
Are you bachelors?
He did his best to be in time for the train.
That's where I went yesterday.
Close your eyes again.
Don't bring your dog with you.
It must've been extremely painful.
You're new here, aren't you?
She had good reason to file for a divorce.
I love your son.
I'm not going to the movies tomorrow.
Tom sings off key.
He is a professor of English at Leeds.
Remember your promise, Tom.
I think you ought to rest a while.
They crossed the border.
Tom has been told several times not to do that.
It's expensive to rent an office in downtown Boston.
I drank a glass of milk this morning.
I'll talk to you later.
I'm glad to meet you.
Tom didn't even tell me.
We thought that would be enough.
They were wrong, of course.
I laughed at his joke.
We don't want to take any chances.
You must wait a while.
Let me win for once.
She was naive.
I'm not accustomed to such treatment.
I can't believe everything that just happened.
Family is important.
What happened to your guitar?
They sat in a circle.
Ask her when she comes back.
He told me that I should be more careful.
Tom shut the kitchen door.
Can you ship it to New York City?
Do you feel like going out for a walk?
I don't know if I've ever told you, but you have beautiful eyes.
This chair is very comfortable, but I don't like the color.
I am sure I can get in touch with him by telephone.
Do I have to spell this out for you?
It's not physically possible.
How long have you been divorced?
He acted like a madman.
I wanted to let you know about that, but Tom told me not to say anything.
What do you say we go there?
Read the article on page two.
I wanted to rent a bus.
She needs you.
You're sure about this, right?
I'm not ready to fight.
He is a little over forty.
I'm much younger than you.
I know that I'm supposed to enjoy this class, but I don't.
They jumped into the water.
How old is your father?
Tom has a large closet in his bedroom.
That is not your knife.
They crushed all resistance.
Tom wasn't in a good mood then.
Don't touch the flowers.
I want to know everything you know.
I let go of the rope.
You must think of your family.
Did you write this fairy tale by yourself?
Just give me what I want.
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.
I'd like to speak to your manager.
Tom wants to come to our party.
He kept me waiting.
Get out of the van.
He wouldn't even look at me.
Would you consider this a good proposal?
She made me a cake.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
He runs a supermarket in the town.
We make sake from rice.
Don't leave the bicycle in the rain.
I've never told anyone that before.
Where did you meet your girlfriend?
She was in a silk dress.
We don't need to do this every day.
Tom scares everybody.
It was he that broke the window yesterday.
You're spoiling the mood.
Tom is aggressive.
How much does this umbrella cost?
I couldn't help yawning.
Why are we here today?
We asked him what he was called.
I will have to help them.
They all looked relieved.
He will get nowhere with his plans.
How did they do that?
A good idea came into my mind.
Your cat is overweight.
Tell me how I can help you.
You're always complaining.
Our dog has gone away.
Many revolutions have aimed to abolish the aristocracy.
Are you here on holiday?
You can use my bicycle.
It's nice to be a role model for others.
I felt cheated.
Saying and doing are two different things.
You know the drill.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
I don't want to talk about this now.
I told you it was stupid.
They will debate the question tomorrow.
Don't you ever touch me again.
You must not stay in bed.
Would you do something for me?
I'm glad to have this opportunity to work with you.
I guess I'd better get back to work.
I don't think it's a wolf.
Turn left at the next corner.
Where's the catch?
I'm tired of it.
Tom never knew his father.
The whole town was in an uproar.
We have till tomorrow night to decide.
How could you be so cruel?
You know I can't.
Is there something that you want to tell me?
I don't want to visit Tom.
Dad extended his legs on the sofa.
I had some things to do before the meeting.
He can run faster than I can.
I shouldn't have to say anything.
What a stroke of luck!
Please tell me the answer to the question.
You have to accept your role.
What color is your house?
I appreciate this so much.
I usually eat lunch at 11:30 to avoid the rush.
I really don't understand what's so funny.
Who is that person?
That's really nice to hear.
They just want someone they can blame.
I feel refreshed.
Don't forget to bring your student ID.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
It's too late to apologize now.
The result was rather disappointing.
He's brighter than they are.
I want to talk to your manager.
Did you call him up yesterday?
When does it end?
He was killed in a car accident.
I don't know how much time I've got.
May I have a talk with you?
Both boys were rescued.
Her condition grew worse last night.
You must not touch the paintings.
I may go out if the rain lets up.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
Now shake hands and make up.
Let's get the party started.
I don't want to get you in trouble.
I was naive.
I'm a farmer.
My opinion doesn't really matter.
Don't forget who you are.
Suddenly, a good idea occurred to me.
I figured I might find you here.
What's in front of you?
The sky is full of dark clouds.
I got what I needed.
He made the most of his opportunity.
I'm psychic.
They're cool.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
Our team is likely to win the game.
Let's call it a day.
He meant no harm.
Our team is winning.
I'm finicky.
You aren't invited.
I turned right.
Don't forget to include me in the count.
Schools are expected to meet the needs of every child, regardless of ability.
You can't see me, can you?
The situation calls for drastic measures.
We're all here.
We all quit.
I'm no expert.
I thought you'd left.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
I just found out that my boyfriend has been stepping out on me.
She was born lucky.
I don't like it when you do that.
Practice what you preach.
Are you almost here?
They had a debate on same-sex marriage.
I am only joking.
I wish I could figure out how to embed a YouTube video.
The elevator is out of order today.
You can't eat here.
Tom left Mary alone in the car.
What had happened wasn't Tom's fault.
We need your assistance.
Come off it!
Tom has finished reading the book that Mary gave him yesterday.
He's good at arithmetic.
Maybe you're right.
I have a dry cough.
He ran into debt.
You look good in black.
Stop being stupid.
What's your job?
The antiques my father left when he died turned out to be nothing but worthless junk.
The table in that room is very nice.
I don't know how else to explain it.
She ironed his shirts.
How much did Tom have to pay for parking?
You remind me of my daughter.
They're undamaged.
Don't interfere in other people's affairs.
They are playing chess.
I just don't remember.
I'm not very organized.
He is quite satisfied with his income.
Can I push the button?
Don't make me come after you.
Are you ready for the trip?
You must read the textbook closely.
It would be better to try.
She pushed him off the pier.
French is not all that difficult to learn.
He was looking at the sky.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
You're embarrassing yourself.
It reminded me of you.
Come whenever you like.
I'm going to build a fire.
That's not funny at all anymore.
Everything has to be perfect.
No one is going to hurt you.
This is where the accident happened.
I do this every day.
I don't know if it is good.
Where's the nearest gas station?
He's kind of cute, isn't he?
The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
The origin of the fire is unknown.
It hasn't been done before.
They got married.
She waited for him to come home.
Your name's further down the list.
You speak French, don't you?
You can trust him with any job.
In my opinion, you're wrong.
It is said that the taste of love is bitter.
She tends to underestimate her own ability.
I have enough money to buy it.
There was only one survivor of the accident.
Are you trying to tell me something?
I apologized profusely.
I found a rare stamp at that store.
He was acting on orders.
I apologize if I offended you.
Tom decided to go home early.
Let's not be in too much of a hurry.
There are huge snakes on this island.
What makes you think that isn't true?
Why did you listen to them?
We never speak French at home.
What he said made us angry.
Where will you go?
You may take the book.
I think he's right.
I searched for the meaning of this word in the dictionary.
It was all done.
I am living with my uncle.
Tom's angry.
Is that for me?
I've been alone for a long time.
We're handling it.
Give me a break.
Don't be lulled into a false sense of security.
Where did the bee sting you?
I don't know that much about you.
I have a sharp pain in my chest.
Whose camera is this?
Let me take your suitcase.
I hope Tom remembered to shave.
He is used to making speeches.
Let's ask a travel agent.
Lock the door.
I know you want to make me happy.
I was delayed by a traffic jam.
They're angry.
That coin is counterfeit.
You won't have a choice.
I hate spinach.
I think we need more ice.
I tried to help him.
Smoking in bed is dangerous.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
Tell Tom I still have his umbrella.
I've always thought you knew how to swim.
Tom wants to open his own restaurant.
You can't know that for sure.
Let go of my arms.
I think we're going to need more time.
Is there a souvenir shop in the hotel?
Tom always makes it a rule never to ask a woman her age.
You've gone too far.
We're friends.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
I hate this.
I don't think I can keep that promise.
Pleased to meet you.
The crow flew away.
The ice was thick enough to walk on.
They are five in all.
He drank a cup of tea and then asked for another.
Ask me tomorrow.
How very curious!
Is tomorrow a holiday?
Did you think of that?
Tom took some coins out of his pocket.
Did you mention my book?
Fill it with regular, please.
I know I've been acting strangely.
What's my room number?
Let us do our job.
Are you really sick?
Don't sell yourself short.
She's asking how that's possible.
You need to be prepared.
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
He peeked inside, afraid of what he would find.
Hey, where did you two come from?
My father came home at nine.
What you make is small potatoes compared to the boss's salary.
I don't know if I can make it to your party or not.
I didn't know where else to go.
I think it's dangerous to swim in this lake.
It's there to the left.
That's a beautiful song.
She breaks a dish every time she washes dishes.
Time is on my side.
It was after midnight.
Who's to say it's not what's supposed to happen?
How can it be done?
How do you do it?
Ask them.
Unless I leave right away, I'll be late for my appointment.
I'm not happy with my job.
He put his hands in his pockets.
Go to the barber.
I have no one to talk to.
I thought you were working.
A woman asked me for directions.
I don't know how long.
He isn't as old as my brother.
Don't tell me he's dead.
It's Saturday today.
I figured I might find you here.
I'd rather she sat next to me.
What's wrong with parading around your own house naked?
Everyone seeks happiness.
She gets along well with him.
We're playing cards.
I need proof.
What do you want to do today?
What can you tell me about that?
I just feel so lost.
Tom arrived three days ago.
That's what Tom told me.
He goes to Karuizawa every year.
If you want quality, pay for it.
I promise you I won't do it again.
Look into my eyes.
It just was not my day yesterday.
Please sit down for a moment.
The flowers brightened up the room.
I know exactly what I'm asking.
There was no response.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
I could get in trouble if I helped you.
I never stopped loving you.
You can't count on Tom's help.
Tom is allergic to eggs.
What's your greatest fear?
Don't do this.
You've risked enough.
I never realized how hard it must be to be a woman.
I want to go.
The lake can be reached in half an hour by bus.
He was granted admission to the university.
I got arrested.
Don't raise your voice.
You don't seem too sure.
I could have done it by myself.
You won't bleed to death.
This car was made in Japan.
She needs our help.
I just thought of something really interesting.
I want to cook for you.
I thought I was going crazy.
No one knows where we are.
You're rich.
You're silly.
Why do so many people visit Kyoto?
It's on the sofa.
We have no need for assistance.
The book you're looking for is on my desk.
He touched my hand.
We had to stop.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
Those two are exactly alike.
Never tell lies.
He has the habit of scratching his head.
You cannot be too careful about spelling.
I amused myself.
You can't know that for sure.
That's pretty much all you need to know.
I made a promise.
No doubt she will come soon.
Tom couldn't contain his anger.
I like cookies.
The mail is delivered once a day.
I know I'm alone on this.
We should try to understand one another.
We were both tired.
She married him at the age of 20.
He began to look for work.
You can't help yourself.
I can't explain anything.
This place smells bad.
He trained very hard.
I will work.
I don't like people like Tom.
It was too muggy for me to get to sleep last night.
How did you handle the situation?
I saw Tom sitting in the third row.
You ought to ask for your teacher's permission.
Do you mind if we come in?
Mary wore a simple white dress.
Those grapes look sweet, but in fact they're sour.
How did you get here so fast?
We prepared snacks beforehand.
Can you please shut up?
We're not welcome.
What's in this box?
He took a walk before breakfast.
You're exhausted.
Tom isn't strong.
I remember you.
I would like to address two questions.
How can you be so sure of that?
In Japan, bowing is common courtesy.
What have we got?
My office is on the fourth floor of that gray six-story building.
Water power turns the wheel.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
I hated history class.
You need a license to drive a car.
Tom probably won't win.
We have to make sure we have enough volunteers.
The boy pressed his face against the shop window.
I have plenty of friends.
I learned a valuable lesson.
Here is a list of moderately priced restaurants.
Do you want this or don't you?
It is wrong to steal.
She is proficient in both Spanish and Italian.
If you eat too much, you'll become fat.
I suggest we leave immediately.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.

I love you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
I don't hate you, Tom.
It's up to you and me.
Advance two steps.
We often have barbecue parties in our backyard.
Can you make it safe?
This house and this land are mine.
I agree with him on that point.
Get it out of here.
You're the leader.
He's a gentleman.
When did he go to Europe?
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
Get control of yourself.
The thief ran away when she saw the policeman.
I like French cooking.
Tom thought it would be a good idea to see a doctor.
That's important.
He is in danger of losing his position unless he works harder.
I don't quite believe what he says.
I tried writing with my left hand.
Everyone was shocked by the news.
I told you I'm not hungry.
Tell me about it!
The following images are not for the faint of heart.
Don't come to me with any excuses.
Nobody came.
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk.
I got acquainted with him last year.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
You deserve more.
I'll never understand.
There are now three cars parked in front of your house.
I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore.
Don't pick your nose.
Do you ever think about that girl?
I would rather die than marry him.
You're very timid.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
I never wear a hat.
There is no doubt about his ability.
Which dictionary did you refer to?
Can you tell the difference between an American and a Canadian?
Who gave you this envelope?
Everything will work out on schedule.
Her heart was throbbing with excitement.
I'm doing everything I can.
She advised him to take better care of himself.
I'm all right.
He raised his arm.
The cause of the accident is not known to us.
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
I'd like to have more time to talk with you.
They'll like that.
Few people live to be 100 years old.
Do you not know who I am?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
May I offer you my chair?
What do you have your feet for?
You're not bleeding.
You've come too early.
I wish you had come with us.
Murder is punished by death.
Computers save us a lot of time and trouble.
Tom is laughing.
We all need to stay together.
Which is the best?
Tom lives next door to us.
I just love bargain sales.
I saw an old woman cross the street.
I'm accustomed to this.
I knew it was right.
Why do I have to do this alone?
This will help keep you warm.
I shouldn't have to put up with this noise.
I feel happy when I'm with you.
My sister always makes fun of me.
I won't repeat anything you say to me.
I applied for a visa.
I stopped laughing.
Forget him.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
I'm not sure if Tom can do that.
I'll get you a glass of water.
She was wearing a negligee.
It might rain. We should take an umbrella.
Everybody calls me Tom.
You have a wonderful voice.
Did you already do your homework?
How does Tom plan to help?
I am afraid they can't get along very well.
He married my cousin.
Today is my birthday.
He introduced his daughter to me.
What did you write?
Do you like to live in the country?
Don't let this chance slip by.
What did the boy say?
Japan's army was very powerful.
As food and drink is to animals, so are rain and sunshine to plants.
Did you understand me?
Get up at once, or you will miss the 7:00 bus.
I packed your suitcase for you.
What's your son's name?
I guess you will be very busy tonight.
That was very rude.
Have you heard the latest rumors?
I'm too busy.
That's the danger.
The cap is too small for me.
We were so worried.
It's new.
Why did I trust you?
Roger Miller was born on January 2, 1936 in the western city of Fort Worth, Texas.
I captured butterflies with a net.
Do you think I'm fat?
What you have said applies only to single women.
He can play the guitar.
This is a mistake.
That was nothing.
Where is the boarding gate for Japan Airlines 124?
Move out of the way.
I don't think it was a mistake.
I'll keep my promise.
He is Japanese.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
Do you recognize anyone?
I used to play here.
Don't talk to me like that.
Not knowing what to do, I asked him for help.
What gave it away?
It isn't optional.
I thought you would understand.
It's been three years since we got married.
I'm asking you as a friend.
Tom began praying.
What are you staring at?
I'm worried about them.
I just realized something.
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
That's disgusting.
Tom is interested in mathematics.
I remember now.
The wind is blowing from the west.
It's a bunch of nonsense.
He works as hard as any student.
This CD is my son's.
I'll be right there.
We elected her captain of our team.
The price is right.
Tom didn't want to go to the doctor.
Tom's guilty.
I'm not trying to say anything.
I don't think I can get you to understand how difficult that is.
I'm still hungry.
Can I eat this cake?
Don't be sad.
There are seven men and four women in my section.
His ID was fake.
I was jealous of my brother.
A thick fog delayed our flight.
How can you contribute to our organisation?
He devoted the last years of his life to writing his autobiography.
You're free of all responsibility.
I want cash.
She glanced briefly at the newspaper.
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
They can't hear you.
He is very tall.
I want to make you happy.
I hope all your dreams come true.
Do you have a credit card?
Keep away from that pond, please.
How're you doing?
Is anyone surprised?
I was right behind you.
The time bomb exploded with a loud noise.
These shirts are all the same size.
It is what everybody says.
I was thinking of getting one.
I know what they're paying you.
What sorts of weapons did they have?
How can you be so selfish?
You are a teacher.
A rabbit has long ears.
I told you so.
It can be improved.
She followed him home; then killed him.
We met at two in the afternoon.
He likes collecting old coins.
I've lost.
I know how you feel.
Do you have many friends?
Don't take any prisoners.
They told me I had to help you.
Is it true that you weren't here yesterday?
I'm open to suggestions.
There's still so much left to do.
He knows nothing about politics.
You're very funny.
I enjoyed swimming.
The important thing is that we're together.
I'm breaking in my new shoes.
The teacher told them not to swim in the river.
I'm a very shy person.
Tom is leaving.
I talked on the phone.
This file is encrypted.
You don't understand what's happening.
What sort of father do you think you'll be?
They ganged up on him.
You seem happy.
He ran away when he saw me.
I haven't seen Tom since Monday.
I know her slightly.
That's what I expected from Tom.
What's wrong with you?
Tom didn't come to school yesterday.
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
What time does your plane depart?
Don't tell anyone about this.
I loved going to the beach.
You're overreacting.
Come alone.
I want you to be my friend again.
You're such a jerk.
What do you think they'll do to me?
Don't let him do it by himself.
How many categories are there?
I don't care what anyone says.
I left my guitar in your office.
You're much prettier than I remember.
She is fresh from college, so she has no experience.
He turned pale at the news.
The heroine of the novel committed suicide.
We keep our most interesting thoughts and the most interesting side of ourselves hidden away.
Sorry, I didn't hear you.
She should be there at noon.
Our dog will bite strangers.
How unlucky I am!
Please be polite.
I don't know what we're going to find, but we should find something.
Is Tom here?
People can begin to love when they choose, but they have no choice when it comes to ending love.
It is their last movie.
Congratulations!
There was a small box inside the big box.
How does that sound to you?
We have to go.
I'm too tired to drive. Could you drive?
I heard something outside.
Tom easily guessed Mary's password.
Let's go to the vegan restaurant.
All roads lead to Rome.
I wasn't sure about that.
What is a UFO?
You can't be sure of that.
As for me, I like this better.
Atomic energy can be used for peaceful ends.
I'm going to my grandmother's.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
Don't call Tom at his home after 2:30.
She handed him the key.
I need to be here all day.
What time did you wake up?
This place isn't so bad.
Where's my ticket?
Of the 23 who were arrested, four escaped.
Yesterday was a good day.
Tom tried to persuade Mary to stay at home.
I asked what was wrong.
Take a look at this map.
I was disappointed.
Tom is too old for me.
I know all I need to know.
I'm happy enough.
It's not like I'm not trying.
The prime minister spoke about the financial crisis at length.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
You should call the police.
At least we're still in one piece.
Did I startle you?
It's very cold now.
I never told you to quit.
Have you bought your Christmas gifts yet?
It may rain.
What's the point of your question?
I just can't understand you sometimes.
We have to acknowledge that.
She's very pretty.
You're safe.
We will play a tennis match.
This movie is for adults only.
There was another problem.
Let me say a few words by way of apology.
Not everything is about you.
He crushed the sheet of paper up into a ball.
You're wise.
I could walk.
Are they actually friends?
It's your duty to vote.
Nobody likes you.
She probably knows.
I guess you didn't quite understand me.
I can't do it alone.
He doesn't have enough experience.
Add a little more milk to my tea, please.
I received my bonus.
We discussed the subject at length.
The disagreement between the union and management could lead to a strike.
He is the head of the sales department.
Finally, I have my own car.
She worships him.
Take one of these.
Don't blame me.
Do you want to look at it?
It feels very similar to this one.
The living room adjoins the dining room.
That's what I'm talking about.
Let me paint you a picture.
Are you interested?
I was really worried about you.
He rejected our offer.
She looked all around.
I thought they'd heard us.
I can protect you.
I want to get back to Boston.
He was just behind me.
If more people had voted, we would have won the election.
I had a hard time leaving.
He was born in the 19th century.
Are you from around here?
I owe what I am today to you.
He flatly refused to let me in.
That's not my name.
She ordered the book from England.
Do your homework by yourself.
I no longer believe it.
I saved your life.
I saw you yesterday.
You're talkative.
He will leave for Paris next month.
I hate that you have to leave.
That book had a lot of pages.
I turned the lights out.
I wonder if Tom knows Mary's phone number.
The opening ceremony took place yesterday.
I can't figure this out.
Are you coming or not?
We wandered aimlessly around the shopping district.
Tom has actually never been to Boston.
Please look for it.
Can we start?
Why do you need a doctor?
I really like puppies.
She has asked the person at the front desk to connect her to that number.
She especially likes music.
His house is by the river.
How long has it been since you received a letter from him?
I don't feel like getting up.
Did I win something?
The richer he became, the more he wanted.
You should write a novel.
Things are complicated.
I hope they're friendly.
He went out a few minutes ago.
She changed her schedule to match his.
She stressed that she did it by herself.
Why are you staying?
I need to find somebody who can babysit on Friday nights.
He asked for a drink of water.
Turn on the air conditioner.
Where is my chainsaw?
Tom sipped some tea.
Let's treat everybody fairly.
I'm just beginning.
I have to be back home by seven.
A dust storm is coming.
Do you mind if I come in?
Stop the car.
He's insecure.
You're not a loser.
I'm not going to show you this.
Have you had dinner?
We were surprised at his conduct.
Are you sure we've never met before?
My heart beats fast each time I see her.
Tom brushed Mary's hair.
I'll call you back later.
Be careful about what you eat.
I must decline.
She usually walks to school.
Guess who's coming for dinner.
I wasn't talking about you.
I'm not marrying you.
I can't conceive how I could have made such a mistake.
Let's review Lesson 5.
The whole class took the test.
Is there anyone who doesn't have one of these?
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
There are fifty members in this club.
I'll never forgive you as long as I live.
I'll leave that to you.
The boats collided head on.
You're taller than I am.
I dropped my earring.
Please sit.
I would advise against it.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I found the earring that you lost.
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
Lock the door when you go out.
I have a lot of ideas.
Maybe we should keep looking.
He clearly stated that point.
That plan failed.
Tom rarely hugs Mary anymore.
She agreed to my idea.
Kids do stupid things.
What're you writing?
They are exhausted.
Tom bought Mary an expensive umbrella.
I wonder if you understand.
Tom expected it to cost a lot more.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
You're the one who decided to do this job, right?
Do you want to be left out?
We'll never know the reason.
It looks like she has a lot of friends.
Are you sure they can do this?
That's why I called.
With the T.V. on, how can you keep your mind on your studies?
Tom said he had plenty of friends in Boston.
I want you to think about this.
That almost made me laugh.
Something changed.
Don't back away.
How am I going to protect my children now?
Would you say they match?
I just got off duty.
Did you sew this by hand?
My house is like yours.
I wish my girlfriend would spend more time with me.
I usually don't bother with people like him.
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea.
She helped me pack my suitcase.
How many children do you have?
Someone stole all my money.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
Tom has a big TV.
We have very good business.
Tom allowed Mary to leave early.
None of this is your fault.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
The worst thing you can do is to only do something half seriously.
They know things these people want to know.
I'll do whatever I can to help you.
The end of the world is coming.
Get rid of the gun.
I love Boston.
The tree fell down.
That dress looks stunning on you.
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
A good idea suddenly struck her.
I don't see how that would help.
I have to go and buy a newspaper.
You are going to have to pay for it.
I enjoyed it very much.
They don't have one.
Your shoes are here.
It's nothing to be alarmed about.
I have many things to do.
Mum's the word.
When did you see her dancing with him?
I'm not your boyfriend.
Is there someone here who speaks French?
I think we're getting close.
History is more complex than you think.
You should prepare for the future.
I hate flying.
Is that music I hear?
Do you want to tell me what this is?
I'll see you around.
Would you like to go to the aquarium with me?
The line is busy again.
Did I give you the tickets?
I can't read this.
I'm used to getting up early.
Leave our house.
I just want to be normal.
Why's Tom still here?
I like being my own boss.
It's the size of a small car.
I was too scared to do anything.
I'll be busy all next week.
My husband earns $100,000 a year.
Tom inhaled.
His office is on the eighth floor.
Most of my friends are guys.
Tom wants me to coach him.
He is no match for his wife.
This sounds like a good idea.
Do you want to see my translations?
You should learn from your mistakes.
Lend me as much money you can.
I thought that was impossible.
I was knocked unconscious.
He left me the keys.
I can't tell you how long I've waited for this.
They did it in front of the staff.
Do you have a fishing license?
Why don't you take off?
I'm downloading the pictures now.
He came downstairs.
Who wants you to be the boss?
This semester I failed two students for plagiarism.
I never went to sleep.
You must stick to your promise.
What would you like to be called?
This doll has big eyes.
Who wants to come with me?
Which program did you watch yesterday?
Just give me the gun.
The bicycle by the door is mine.
Let's get out of the taxi.
A dog was running.
You're very upset.
Someone should talk to him and tell him what's what.
There's a table.
Her composition had no grammatical errors at all.
I understand how you feel.
He's a kind person.
I've enjoyed my stay.
She dumped him because she thought he was a jerk.
You are too critical of others' shortcomings.
Tom sat down on the couch.
It is certain that he will come here.
I love seeing you so happy.
She drew the chair towards her.
All of a sudden, all the lights went out.
I think maybe Tom has something else to do.
Tom says he's read this book three times.
I'm helping people to buy things online.
I want to figure this out.
You won't be harmed.
I'm happy because you're here.
They refused.
What'll we do if Tom is late?
What's your favorite wine?
I don't want to shoot you.
She kept on dancing all through the party.
I cannot help laughing at her jokes.
We take good care of them.
That job paid well.
It's a cautionary tale.
We can't leave Tom here. He won't survive on his own.
Within hours, the world knew the news.
It is too cold for a picnic today.
Can we change rooms?
I am expecting some serious work from you.
Let's all help Tom.
I would like to get to know you better.
Would you come here a moment?
Don't write in red ink.
I had my hat blown off.
Tom drives an imported car.
I don't know what else to try.
I'm sure you'll do very well.
Who's to say which is better?
I'm going to lay aside that money for emergencies.
Is that why you want to hurt me?
Luckily, I won first prize.
I know you're working part-time.
I ache all over.
The air was full of flying bullets.
His brother is more patient than he is.
Why do I believe you?
We spent the weekend with friends.
Tom decided to call the police.
I have read every book in the library.
That's his.
Tom didn't look very well.
Life is very short.
You need to be careful.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
This book belongs to you.
I think you shouldn't be doing that.
We're doing everything we can to find your son.
You're not my friend.
Do you know anyone who's not on Facebook?
He killed himself.
What's your blood type?
He prefers not to talk about it.
How much did you spend on Christmas gifts this year?
I'd like you to do your best.
I think I've seen enough.
It's your bedtime.
He apologized profusely.
There's no way I'm going to work on Sunday.
We have to solve this problem.
Hurry up and you can still catch your train.
I'm a professor, or rather an associate professor, to be exact.
This storm is not dangerous. You don't need to worry.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Is your sister married?
I'm going to take my car.
I wonder which of you will win.
Some people believe in ghosts.
How old are you now?
I forgot you were listening.
Tom already has our respect.
Tom began to feel tired.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
What're we waiting for?
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
I go to the beach almost every day.
I guess I was mistaken.
I think about you often.
You're so predictable.
Isn't that nice?
Make love, not war.
My uncle gave me this watch.
This book is for students whose native language is not Japanese.
Don't talk about my family.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
You have more energy than I do.
Are you coming to the store with me?
I was tired.
The movie was too long.
He can be proud of his father.
Let's keep this a secret, OK?
She died from TB.
I remember reading about it.
I thought you wanted to come with us.
The audience was deeply affected.
I don't know what to do with it.
What time is your curfew?
I'm sure you're going to like this.
I haven't seen you around before.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
The truth is I don't like Tom.
It is very hot today.
I listened.
That job bores me to death.
They decided to put an end to the discussion.
Do I look busy to you?
Do you want to watch this movie again?
After decades of civil war, order was restored.
I live in a rural area.
Don't ask me about the speech.
We're not related.
Please come.
You look familiar.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
There was another one.
This doesn't feel right.
I saw him looking at me.
It's your problem, not mine.
My wife is a good manager.
I'm quiet.
You need to relax.
I love to see you smile.
We may as well start at once.
She began to like him right away.
I can't imagine my life without you.
If I were you, I would trust her.
She is interested in music.
I get good grades.
We missed the deadline.
Are you going to buy the car?
It was his fault.
We need evidence.
I remember when I was about your age.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
You need to be careful when you're driving a car.
Where I am doesn't matter.
Tom has enough money.
I'm not scared to die.
There is a clock on the wall.
He is captain of the football team.
Tom spoke.
Nothing is more valuable than time, but nothing is less valued.
They're all watching us.
I put my helmet on.
I've been to Hokkaido before.
Are you listening?
Stop flirting with my sister.
I told Mary I wanted a divorce.
Leave us.
I have a dictionary.
You need to be more patient.
You're lucky that you have a job.
I thought I was going crazy.
I was only saying my prayers.
I always have a lot of fun when I come here.
They made Tom an offer.
His business has gone from bad to worse.
Maybe she can tell you more.
Tom sealed the envelope.
Use this as a model.
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.
It's not quite as difficult to do as it sounds.
I'm sorry, I really am.
Tom is trying to earn enough money to buy a new trumpet.
That looks like tea.
A lot can happen in a year.
Father suddenly got sick and we sent for a doctor.
We rented an apartment when we lived in New York.
I promised him that I would come today.
Nobody goes outside in this kind of weather.
She is after a better job.
They believe in God.
What's the point of not eating?
Keep the door open.
How did you all get here?
I work in the morning.
Do you see a star?
I do hope Tom does what he says he'll do.
If you spend too much time in the sun without putting on sunscreen, you are likely to get a sunburn.
Do you have the schedule?
Who's Tom's mother?
I know Tom likes to travel.
Tom usually has a glass of wine before dinner to whet his appetite.
That's close enough.
The money we offered them was obviously not enough.
Now leave us.
Did they tell you why you had to do this?
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
Anything you say may be used against you.
I arrived too late.
Watch us.
I'm not used to this heat.
I'm experiencing some heartburn.
The last one is the best.
Let's talk over a cup of tea, shall we?
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
This is not my car.
Father always says, "Do your best."
That gave me a rough idea.
Tom's bag was badly damaged.
Preventive measures are much more effective than the actual treatment.
Have you figured out the cost?
Have you ever walked through a graveyard at midnight?
He is afraid of getting lung cancer.
Get it out of here.
No one listened to me.
It is their only choice.
What do you like to do in your free time?
Not everyone believed this plan was a good one.
We used to talk about our future.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
This breaks my heart.
That's the way he likes it.
Try these shoes on and see if they fit you.
I like having breakfast with you.
What's new with you?
It looks like we're all here.
How did you manage to win?
There is a pair of scissors on the desk.
I miss college.
Does he have a girlfriend?
Don't leave things half finished.
Please make yourself at home.
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my wife?
It's important that you hear this.
Do you understand what I am saying?
You're overemotional.
Tom sang me a song.
He sometimes watches TV.
I'd be very grateful if you could help me.
Save it on the external hard drive.
I want them all shot.
This car is my father's, but it'll soon be mine.
Her anxiety was apparent to everyone.
Tom is an excellent marksman.
Their car overtook ours.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
Part of this conviction is rooted in my own experience.
The house is too big for us, and what is more, it is too expensive.
I don't think any of us should go.
He is familiar with computers.
He's highly intelligent.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
The hotel was designed by a Japanese architect.
She mixed him up with someone else.
Is there anything else you want from me?
I cannot do without this dictionary.
How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
What brand of cigarettes do you smoke?
I hate that you have to leave.
I put it on your desk.
How did you get them?
I want to drink.
They don't know what they are missing.
I knew you'd like it.
I think I'm done.
They will survive.
How do you like them apples?
I really am glad you're here.
You may use his library.
I am badly in need of your help.
I have a car that was made in Japan.
Tom also likes to play the flute.
I'd like to know how you got my phone number.
You lost the game.
The barbells are heavy.
A gunshot was heard in the distance.
He rescued the child from the burning house.
You need an ambulance.
I'm getting old.
They clung together for warmth.
Can we get started now?
Tom decided not to go to the meeting.
She divided the cake into five pieces.
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
How did I get into this?
Are you sincere?
What difference does it make if people are looking at us?
English is pretty hard, isn't it?
You're very emotional.
Raise your hand.
She raised her voice.
I tried thinking about why it was that I didn't trust him.
I'm not convinced at all.
This chair is Tom's.
In my city, there is no school for learning Esperanto.
If we leave now, we should make it.
A considerable amount of money was appropriated for the national defense.
I'm too busy.
He moves quickly.
I appreciate your taking the time to see me.
Did I hurt your feelings?
Don't you think I would like to do that?
I think I know why Tom isn't here.
It's already eleven.
I heard somebody talking.
It never occurred to me that I might get arrested.
I think you'll find this interesting.
I'm uninsured.
Well, that's upsetting.
Can you tell me how to fill in this form?
You're still mad, aren't you?
Do you want some company?
This knife is very sharp.
Do you know where my recipe book is?
I didn't know where else to go.
Where did I put that box?
After dinner, I walk on the beach.
Keep the door locked.
I'm a little bit tired today.
I've got everything I want.
It's been unusually warm this week.
They're mad at you.
I'm beautiful.
Your name sounds familiar to me.
How can I quit this job?
You never asked why.
Tom will be back next week.
They will hold talks tomorrow.
I didn't order dinner.
I have thirteen cats.
What did you do exactly?
This umbrella looks like mine.
Both of them started crying.
If you want to achieve the kind of success that I think you do, then you'll have to study harder.
The Titanic hit an iceberg.
Aren't you happy?
Do you understand what's going on?
There's nothing more I can tell you.
She couldn't convince him to buy her a new car.
He applies this principle to everything in life.
Does she like oranges?
It's cheaper to order things by the dozen.
Anyone home?
How long do you have to eat lunch?
Save up so that you can go to college.
You're such a flirt.
They made me really angry.
Did you shoot Tom?
I have to run.
The twins are very much alike.
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
He lives in a village.
Do you have the painting?
We have not been notified about their change of address.
Please go to the bank.
I'm glad you asked that question.
We'll swim.
Take no chances.
Get a job so you can support your wife and kids.
Mary is a single mom.
It seems like it might rain this afternoon.
We'll fail.
Did you take a shower today?
Quit acting like a baby.
You are not to leave this room.
I need to jump start my car.
He plays soccer.
We can be a lot better.
What's the plan, Tom?
Are you following me?
There's an answer to everything.
I hate what I've become.
I addressed the envelope containing the invitation.
I've been doing this longer than you.
It was impossible for the boy to swim across that river.
I hate winter.
It's fairly mild for this time of year.
You're too tense.
This is your only chance.
Is death the only way out?
The cat drank her milk.
I caught them in the act.
Everybody knows that Tom likes Mary.
Is it difficult work?
We'll explain.
Tom helped us all.
Please call him.
Can you take the lid off this box?
What's your favorite lipstick color?
She loved her mother dearly.
The population of Shanghai is as large as that of Tokyo.
I lost my papers.
Tom is trying to break the lock.
My car is parked not far from here.
The light is out.
How did you meet him?
You reach him by calling this number.
Are you insured?
Attendance is mandatory.
Do you have a telephone?
I did it in a couple of days.
Do it somewhere else.
We didn't need that.
Tom seemed disappointed.
Please forward this to as many people as possible.
Can't you understand that it's impossible?
The accent of this word is on the second syllable.
Don't waste your time trying to convince Tom.
Tom didn't know Mary was dating John.
Don't get any ideas.
If you could do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
I began to be afraid you would never come back again.
We got lucky.
Tom almost never speaks French.
She was not in the mood for lunch.
She looked at him angrily.
Don't forget to pay the phone bill.
I had to do my duty.
From the hill, we could see all the buildings in the city.
Buy me a drink.
Don't tell me that again.
You should follow your teacher's advice.
Who are you there with?
I was nearly hit by a car.
I'm looking forward to meeting you all after such a long time.
He is there for a few days.
That's a pretty name.
I don't know what more I can say.
They'll kill you.
I didn't have much time.
Upon seeing what was happening, we decided to leave.
He is not what he seems.
I take it you don't agree.
How's your kid doing?
That doesn't sound good.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
These clothes are dirty and need washing.
I met a friend while I was waiting for a bus.
I'm the one who should be doing this.
If it were not for water, we could not live.
I'm leaving tonight.
They come from the same town.
A bird can glide through the air without moving its wings.
You're demented.
Don't make the same mistake again.
My father cut wood with a saw.
Why should Tom sing?
Don't back away.
How do you know that?
I would never do it again.
That never used to bother me.
I just can't wait to go to work.
Do you speak Chinese?
I forgot to tell you my phone number.
In a few days, the baby will be able to walk.
I hate computers.
French is difficult to learn.
I'm very pleased with your work.
I take my hat off to you.
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job.
What do you need?
Tom loves Mary.
We understand each other.
I seem to have caught a bad cold.
I know who gave that to you.
I have until tomorrow to finish this.
You can go back to bed.
I feel sad when I think about all the people who die in wars.
This is the lady who wants to see you.
We're committed.
I want another beer.
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
We must try to protect the environment.
I can't believe Tom knows where Mary lives.
All the leaves on the tree turned yellow.
She wasn't able to meet him.
I didn't tell Tom anything.
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
I don't know what that is.
What have you come here for?
Do you have a mobile phone?
Tell me again where you live.
She stared at him with frightened eyes.
You're just like your father.
They're anxious for peace.
Can you help us?
What are you up to?
He got bogged down at work.
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll always be there for you.
I totally forgot.
I prefer to do it alone.
Please hand this in at the front desk.
Why don't you want to come with us?
We broke up.
This neighborhood is very scary.
Could I borrow your eyeliner?
I don't suppose anything will happen.
The worst is over.
We need to go.
He always says the same thing.
I'm tired, but I'll study hard.
He's attracted to Asian girls.
He sat there with his legs crossed.
I'm worried about the baby.
I'm looking for a job.
I can sleep on the sofa.
How much does your daughter weigh?
I am new here.
Why did you ditch me?
The sky is blue.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
His house is not far from here.
I don't want to torment you any longer.
I want this fixed as soon as possible.
I've never done it like that before.
Judging from his accent, he must be from Kyushu.
Where's the catch?
I don't notice any difference.
I am very sorry for what I said.
That swimsuit looks really good on you.
Tom tried to control his emotions.
Ask only questions that can be answered with yes or no.
This is impossible for me.
If you want to stay here, you are welcome to.
I can do it in half the time.
Tom doesn't like any kind of music.
I'd do anything for those kids.
I thought you might be interested in this.
She showed me her new car.
That's how I came to know her.
Everyone can do better.
Don't talk to anybody about this.
We could be happy here.
I brought you another blanket.
Tom explained the decision.
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
I hear you were grounded.
Cows eat grass.
That comes to the same thing.
We used to be best friends.
He put the box on the table.
Are you absolutely sure of that?
I had no idea you were involved.
Clean your room.
He imitated the works of Van Gogh.
I don't do this for the money.
I like her novel.
Since this is your neck of the woods, maybe you can tell us where to find a good pizza joint.
That's right.
Your explanation is too abstract to me.
Put it on my account.
Does this bus go to the beach?
He left his wife.
He repaired my watch for me.
One must keep one's promises.
She was astonishingly beautiful.
Almost everyone arrived on time.
You don't have the time.
Have you seen Tom lately?
We are sorry for the interruption.
Your cat is fat.
Don't tell anybody.
She has no children, does she?
I attended the meeting yesterday.
How old will you be next year?
All of the students have to wear the same uniform.
Tom doesn't know how computers work.
Is that what you want me to say?
Someone knocked on the door.
I see they've put you to work.
Are you a Japanese student?
I can't tell you where Tom lives.
You shouldn't drink this water.
Tom is always cheerful.
Work harder if you plan to succeed.
I'm in love with somebody else.
The old man has enough money.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Tell me which of the two cameras is the better one.
There were too many of them.
Forward this to everyone you know.
I went to sleep during the lesson.
He went away without saying a word.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
I admire you for your courage.
Thank you for all the gifts.
Can I set a place at the table for you?
Is there something in there?
I have to do what's right.
I really am very busy.
I feel normal.
I know that Tom knows.
You're aggressive.
I'll help you after work if I'm not too tired.
Did you read what I wrote?
He rolled his eyes.
I just don't want to die.
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.
Give it to anyone you like.
I think I ate a little too much today.
You should ask Tom what happened.
I'm going to make you an offer that you can't refuse.
I've been thinking about you, too.
A treatment will cure the disease.
It was a fine day, so we went swimming.
There were hundreds of birds on the lake.
That boy has black hair.
Australia is one of the countries I want to visit before I die.
Do you think her story is false?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This is an equilateral triangle.
Have you lost your ticket?
Did I give it to you?
Darwin changed the world.
I'm getting too old for this job.
I don't need more advice.
From our point of view, his proposal is reasonable.
I had some fun.
Is it free?
Can we get some sleep?
Tom is always watching television.
She likes painting pictures.
I thought you quit.
I was attacked and robbed on my way home.
She whispered it in my ear.
How may I help you?
I can't excuse her.
I don't know if there is time.
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
It's made of brass.
Will he succeed or fail?
I would like a glass of water.
It was raining last night.
I think it's sad to not have any friends.
You're fair.
You should do that.
I never thought I'd be doing this alone.
Respect yourself and you will be respected.
A lot of people would like to become famous. However, a lot of famous people wish they weren't so famous.
He will have to go to the station.
Can you pick it up?
I didn't have enough space to fit my lunch in the bag.
He showed courage in the face of great danger.
That's all I needed to hear.
I've been trying to get your attention.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
Who told you Tom was sick?
Were you busy yesterday?
Tom started clearing the table.
I had my watch repaired at the store.
Do not give in to those demands.
How many inhabitants are there?
I was eating dinner then.
I hurried to the station only to find that the train had already left.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
May I have a straw, please?
He didn't get the joke.
He suggested that I accompany him to the party.
I wasn't aware that Tom was unhappy here.
I'm just not sure.
I have a lot of problems to solve.
I think you're nuts.
How did you find me?
I think everybody's happy.
That's not hard to do.
I don't know what I owe you.
I hate secrets.
How long have you been living in Tokyo?
We've all seen it.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
The shower doesn't work.
Tom just got back to Boston today.
He often asks silly questions.
I know a lot about it.
I did my best.
You can have this watch for nothing.
He was laughed at in public.
I'm suspicious of everybody.
Should we wait?
I saw tears in her eyes.
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.
Jeans are now in fashion among girls.
That was our biggest problem.
Did you pay for the book?
It's very hard to play Vivaldi's bassoon concerto on the saxophone.
He was seized with fear.
I want you to tell me everything you know about that.
What people say is not always true.
I don't have to talk to you.
Tom makes a lot of mistakes.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
Would you like another piece of pie?
You look busy.
She likes sleeping.
My mother is busy preparing supper.
It's been my dream since I was a little girl.
We're getting it.
I don't care a bit about the future.
You look a little green around the gills.
What is the total amount of money you spent?
If you help me, I'll try it again.
He looks much better now.
She made an excuse for being late.
I used to work in a bank.
Do you like French literature?
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
I'll always be here to help you.
Is it OK to drink alcoholic drinks in this park?
Zoology deals with the study of animal life.
Is there something that you want to tell me?
They didn't offer me anything to drink.
Do you need a few minutes?
I stayed up till late at night.
She gave him a watch.
You would look stupid wearing your mother's dress.
I was fired in 2013.
I'm starting to feel desperate.
He may have missed the train.
Tom took surf lessons.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
I don't want to raise false hopes.
I only slept two hours.
I'll never be able to sleep.
Did you see anyone at the mall?
I need to get some air.
You don't seem very pleased.
Let me buy you a drink.
One morning, she unexpectedly met him on the street.
You stay away from her.
I hadn't intended to work at this company this long.
We're not going to make a decision overnight.
I want you to find out about that.
How long do I have to wait for the next bus?
He missed the last train.
Is your watch correct?
That's what I was working on.
We're studying French.
Tom retired earlier this year.
I think you and he wanna be alone.
They assigned the task to us.
How do you know which one is yours?
The syntax of Python scripts is very simple.
I'm wasted.
I didn't know that you used to work here.
I called you.
Can you complete the job in two days?
Tom washes his car once a week.
It is two miles from here to the park.
She put the children to bed.
Anything is possible.
I didn't tell him you were coming.
You might try that.
The girl has no mother.
Birds evolved from dinosaurs.
Please do it quickly.
She used to enjoy being with him.
I want to know who sent you.
She grew up near the sea, yet she hates swimming.
I was bitten in the leg by that dog.
Please don't do that anymore.
I refused to believe it.
Come at once.
Do you remember anything?
Lead the way.
I'll never stop.
I don't like it when you're so busy.
I don't care if it snows.
You're the one who trained me.
Can you speak French well?
What sort of things do you do on weekends?
What's your favorite movie?
Get out while you can.
I thought it best for him to say nothing about the matter.
If you really cared about your girlfriend, you would respect her feelings.
He removed his sunglasses.
Your friends are late.
I just want life to be like it was before.
We became best friends.
They struggled.
Is it painful?
I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
Where do you come from?
Tom is a French teacher.
The government should invest more money in industry.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
Many people are on vacation.
Let me go!
Tom was a better cook than Mary was when they got married.
It's not too much.
Prices are high.
How much do you want?
I feel a little awkward.
I'll call if I hear anything.
He's an interpreter in an international bank.
Your wife left.
In fact, she's quite unreliable.
I love California.
He presented his card.
Go to your room now!
Tom turned on the car radio.
He is a bus driver.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Did I miss something this morning?
Tom looks just like a guy I know.
I'm sorry for what I said. I was out of line.
Please write down everything I say.
We live in a complicated world.
We're contributing.
I had hoped we might become friends.
I was thinking of getting one.
How many were wounded?
This building is ancient.
I saw the man jump.
It'll be easy.
I really wish you hadn't seen that.
I didn't want you involved in this.
He paid the money back.
She trusts him.
I want everything to be perfect.
I went to wash my hands.
I am not in the least afraid of dogs.
I'm fairly happy.
She was pale with fear.
I thought you might come.
There are no spoons.
The gate was left open.
The teachers greeted the children.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
Who knows more about you than your own mother?
You don't have the right.
Don't worry. Everything's OK.
They may leave tomorrow.
Are you afraid of getting hurt?
Tennis is loads of fun.
Our uncle bought us movie tickets.
I had a crush on you when I was twelve.
What did Tom give you for Christmas?
He could not hold back his tears.
May I offer you my chair?
We have to change our plan.
Isn't that enough for you?
You're not fat.
You're the one that went crazy.
His family emigrated to the United States.
I took it for granted that you would come.
Don't talk to me about religion.
He was absent because of the storm.
They don't take care of that dog.
My sister is pretty.
You have a lot of nerve.
I don't want to play anymore.
That's cheap, isn't it?
I have a theory.
We must attack.
Tom told us to take our time.
Tom didn't know what to believe.
I'd hate to see that happen again.
He adjusted the telescope to his sight.
He asked for money.
I'd really like it if we could be friends.
I'm not even a little hungry.
The house is vacant.
Who is the girl in the pink dress?
The company presented him with a gold watch on the day he retired.
There are many interesting people in the world.
I imagine that you went through a lot of difficulties.
If I were you, I would not do it.
You can't keep treating me like a kid.
Tom goes swimming almost every day.
Our school is across the river.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
Tom didn't know how to say "thank you" in French.
Let's talk man to man.
Where's the catch?
Even though computer programmers may use semicolons every day, nowadays most people only use semicolons for emoticons.
You can start anytime.
Put this book on top of the others.
You're demented.
I just thought you were happy.
Tom ordered Mary to do it.
I want the same jacket as you are wearing.
Look, I want you to do me a favor.
She argued with him about money.
I glanced through the brochure.
Our TV is out of order.
I can't let you in there.
The rebels took control of the capital.
The bank lent him 500 dollars.
I had the same problem when I was your age.
This is a message for you.
Your house needs painting.
The sudden death of his brother surprised them.
It pays to be polite.
Who's your father?
Tom promised not to smoke anymore.
Tell me what happened.
I really don't want to live here.
The concert was a success.
The stock market is very active.
We were disconnected.
The death toll from the hurricane climbed to 200.
I need to know.
She is very bitter toward me.
Tom said he felt rested and was ready to start hiking again.
He had scarcely escaped when he was recaptured.
She baked me a cake.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
I don't know where I'd begin.
I can't give up.
Nobody was home.
You can't leave.
Do you know what day it is today?
You're out of touch with reality.
You don't get up as early as your sister, do you?
You'll have a rough time.
It is very hard to date this vase.
They're all the same.
He didn't only teach at school, he also wrote novels.
You have a lot of nerve!
We happened to meet at the station.
We walked around the pond.
"Leave me alone," she said angrily.
I walked toward the park.
I had lunch with Tom at a restaurant near the office.
I thought you had more sense than that.
Who are you there with?
You have a great imagination.
I have to clean the house.
I'm willing to apologize.
Why did you sign the confession?
I get nervous when I speak before a large audience.
I suspect you're wrong.
How long have you been doing this?
Rules are meant to be kept, not broken.
I just want to know what to expect.
Tom says that he's never tried eating dog food.
She stopped talking.
I want proof.
I think we've waited long enough.
I'm going to hit the hay.
He will not be back tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was coming over for dinner.
What's your favorite pizza topping?
Are there any bears around here?
This may be research my secretary did.
How many people do you know well?
I don't know what your problem is.
Do it again!
You'll give me away.
The view is beautiful beyond words.
The desk drawer is open.
Take as many as you want.
What do you remember?
She worked hard.
She found him handsome.
He spoke highly of you.
I don't know that much about you.
He broke up the chair for firewood.
I never thought Tom would follow me here.
Have you been drinking?
You're killing me.
He was sentenced to prison.
I suppose you love her.
Both of them are hungry.
What did you eat for lunch today?
We wanted to wish you good luck.
Let us help you do that.
I still have mine.
I'll see you at the party.
It is no use giving her advice.
I accept your challenge.
I advise you never to live beyond your income.
You're smarter than me.
The very thought is abhorrent to me.
Please remain seated.
You can't save me.
Could you kill someone?
To put it briefly, she turned down his proposal.
Do you know who painted this picture?
I'm not worried about him.
Are you sure of it?
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
I'll warn Tom.
He didn't keep his word.
Let me try that.
I can prove it to you.
I'm not going to sell it.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
Tom parked the car behind Mary's house.
You're bossy.
Do you have something that you want to say to me?
Could you spare me a few minutes?
All you have to do is to wait.
Who's the highest bidder?
She ran as fast as she could.
I like painting, too.
Let's leave early.
Apparently, the murder happened in a locked room.
Did you see the sunset earlier? It was really beautiful.
You have gone too far this time.
Are you hot?
Tom hasn't forgiven anybody.
I hardly got any sleep last night.
Don't keep me waiting.
You've been great.
Several students came to the library.
Don't die.
Would you like more mashed potatoes?
He's a newcomer.
This school has no heating.
That's why I need your help.
Let's go by bus.
Do you agree?
They visited their parents yesterday.
Do you live around here?
Look at the blackboard, everyone.
Hi! What's new?
You're very emotional.
She was busy with her knitting.
A problem shared is a problem halved.
I didn't say you did that.
I don't like what you did to Tom.
Everything is new.
She lives in New York.
No one would offer him a job.
You're not ready yet, are you?
She called him to say that she'd be late.
I will go.
Studying how to communicate effectively is time well spent.
There's a catch.
Don't sit on the floor.
Let me go.
Break time's over.
Do you have a date for Valentine's Day?
He has knowledge and experience as well.
Has Tom eaten yet?
It's not supposed to happen.
When did he go?
I think it's time for me to split some more firewood.
You can stay with us for the night.
Everyone has faults.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
I thought they were wrong.
You'll understand it later on.
Skip the boring chapters.
There's usually someone here.
They huddled together.
It's funny.
Can you supply me with everything I need?
Her face was drenched with sweat.
It's weird.
He surprised his opponent.
She was fully clothed.
I haven't seen any of his films.
I know your time is valuable, but could I ask you just one question?
May I speak to the lady of the house?
Our cat's fur has lost its luster.
I made fun of him.
I have to be there at 2:30.
May I ask you a favor?
Tom knew that Mary had done her best.
The light is changing from red to green.
A lot of my classmates think that I'm dumb.
His sister looks young.
I can't believe I'm going to lose my job.
I'd like to drink something hot.
I don't like her face.
Stop reading comic books while working.
I thought I could deal with it.
Where did you see the boy?
It would be a good idea to try doing that.
I just don't understand you.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Drastic times call for drastic measures.
What do you learn English for?
I would rather have a cat than a dog.
These animals are friendly.
Do you want in or not?
Tom got a call from someone named Mary.
I will be able to pass the test.
I don't have a lot of options.
I hate this part of the movie.
We should study together.
Bilingual dictionaries are allowed.
I finally found out what happened.
How come you didn't come to the party?
I opened the drawer.
There's a park near my house.
Are you flirting with him?
Did you read everything?
We can't use cellphones in here.
You got what you wanted, didn't you?
Why was I not informed?
You can't leave until you've said goodbye to Tom.
I often do that for Tom.
It really bugged me.
He thinks I love her.
Young people are prone to fall into temptation.
You can tell me anything.
If you flunk this exam, you'll have to repeat the course.
He has many history books.
Do you enjoy living like this?
We noticed the man enter her room.
I made friends with them at the school festival.
She always speaks English.
It is not known when he came up to London.
She is mad at me.
I don't know how to explain it.
I lit the candle.
I don't know how to contact you.
This plan had little chance of success.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
See what happens when you give people advice?
I talked about music.
He would give an arm and a leg for that.
How did you all get here?
You should be careful not to become overconfident.
I regret that I didn't go there.
Can you ship it to New York City?
Where were we?
Is this really happening?
He is capable of teaching French.
Is there anything to drink in the fridge?
Did you tell Tom why you're here?
I really want to understand.
Tom gave me some money.
A mile is equal to about 1600 meters.
He was the first man to cross the Pacific.
What a big dog!
I went through a lot of trouble.
I'll always be here.
He made a vivid impression.
They grew closer.
It was just water.
Tom is a crook.
What time did you wake up?
Tom knows a lot of proverbs.
I don't want you to be upset.
It's about to explode!
The cat is adorable.
Irritating, isn't it?
We're out of stock.
We had not gone very far when it started to rain.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
Try it once again.
I guess that's good for you.
Please be polite.
The world has five oceans.
Are you Japanese?
I had a very hard time writing the paper.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
He has done many things for poor people.
Did you mention my book?
You hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom draws well.
Who do you think you are to speak to me that way?
It only takes a few minutes.
He had no difficulty in finding the place.
She left her children.
They have enough money.
I like Japanese girls.
It's not worth reading any further.
We happened to meet at the station.
He passed away.
We're home early.
We want you to be the team captain.
My back is killing me.
You are in my way.
You told Tom not to come, didn't you?
What were you afraid of?
You have a lot of money, and I have none.
Obviously, he is lying.
Why do you care so much?
I've been a teacher for 15 years.
I've lost my keys.
You can't believe everything you hear.
I want to read the book.
The wind has died down.
We're not cops.
They're there.
He'll never forgive me.
She accused me of being a liar.
You may open the window.
He just returned from abroad.
I'm on holiday.
You'll soon be able to sing as well as Tom.
It is under the chair.
We went to the café that I told you about.
That's what I wanted to hear.
A severe ocean storm hit the West Indies.
I'm sorry we can't stay any longer.
Come soon or there won't be any food left.
Children can't drink wine.
I'm sure Tom will be home soon.
You're famous.
You should distinguish between right and wrong.
He is going to stay at a friend's house.
How are you planning to do that?
Does Tom still play the guitar?
The government's investment will create many jobs.
The food is on the table.
I don't think I can wait that long.
They live on the floor beneath.
I'll be checking on you.
I'm a masochist.
Tom is the one who broke the window yesterday.
I am all alone in a foreign country.
It was raining last night.
Every sentence in that book is important.
A rope was thrown into the water.
This is the last time I'm telling you to do that.
The kid has a keen sense of hearing.
Have a piece of pie.
Which is your target?
It seems he's still alive.
I haven't eaten any meat since I was fifteen years old.
I want to know about you.
You weren't even there.
I would like to go to Austria to study music.
Tom doesn't have to eat this.
He wanted to be a farmer.
Can you please take this package to the post office?
I don't regret what happened last night.
Back off!
Is this love?
How come you know English so well?
She took him to the zoo.
Words failed her.
I was going to go.
You're the champion, aren't you?
You're the engineer.
This afternoon the weather is going to get worse.
I'm too old for this sort of thing.
Is that still my room?
Unless you started learning English as a child, you're unlikely to ever sound like a native speaker.
I think you're too picky.
You had no choice.
We lay on the grass.
This game is so hard.
I can't believe I'm going to lose my job.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Forget your sorrows.
I'm not crying.
Tom is your friend.
You know the drill.
That's quite simple.
Is he all right?
When I grow up, I want to be a king.
I just did what they told me to do.
I was happy yesterday.
It's not stupid.
I got you a little something.
No one asked you.
Do you have rain gear with you?
It went viral.
I love the sound of rain on the roof.
I put on a little weight last year.
Tom comes here nearly every day.
He offered ten dollars for our old radio.
I think she will succeed as a lawyer.
You must be very busy these days.
I was alone in the classroom.
He's studying.
You'll like it, believe me.
It's about time.
I have plenty of friends.
They are very kind.
Tom has decided to sell his car.
He knows how to cheat people.
I bit my tongue.
We can't just act as if nothing has happened.
Did you have a nice evening?
How would you describe yourself?
I followed the recipe.
Flies and mosquitoes interfered with his meditation.
We've been talking about this for hours. Can we just drop it?
That'll be all.
I just followed your instructions.
Sulfur is used to make matches.
He kept all the windows open.
I feel like going to the movies.
I want to talk to him about it.
I can't believe we're all still here.
He will not change his mind in spite of my advice.
Trying to find happiness only makes you unhappy.
I learned to live without her.
His clothes always smell bad.
It's getting warmer and warmer.
It was all a big lie.
I don't feel like doing it.
Have they spotted you?
He goes to school.
I've got my pride.
You may go at once.
Fill the jars with water.
What did you eat?
I refused to pay.
Everybody had a good year.
Tom and Mary are hitchhiking.
Are they worth it?
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
I saw Tom standing there.
She was lying face down on the bed.
With the bridge destroyed, there was nothing to do but swim.
There are a lot of people here today.
It's nearly impossible.
How nice!
It's not very far from here.
It was flat.
You're good.
He seldom, if ever, goes to church.
I didn't need to paint the fence.
He has little money.
That was interesting.
Losing your health is worse than losing your money.
I wonder who.
You can't help now. It's too late.
The news quickly spread.
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
Sometimes I say "yes," even though I want to say "no."
Are you afraid of death?
Whenever he comes to this place, he orders the same dish.
I know her well.
Is today your birthday?
You say I should know him quite well, but as a matter of fact, I was introduced to him only last week.
I think she's 40 years old.
I'm thorough.
That dog is so stupid.
I didn't want to tell you that on the phone.
I cannot lend this book to you.
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.
You're temperamental.
I stayed indoors because it rained.
We must talk.
It doesn't get better than this.
Is it hazardous?
You never want to give anything away.
Tom pulled the rope.
I know you must be afraid.
Does he like me?
You are so stupid.
It all happened kind of fast.
It's slightly windy.
Let's see.
I wanted to laugh.
Nobody wants to work with you.
He will keep us informed.
Women like men who make them feel special.
I kind of like this place.
I forgave you a long time ago.
How far did it go?
This is most unfortunate.
You're very helpful.
I must go alone.
You speak too much.
Drop me a line when you get there.
We can't see anything.
We all cheered.
The accident has caused many deaths.
We want Tom to know he can come home.
There's no choice.
Did you stop Tom?
We're kidding.
You will keep your word, won't you?
I am very pleased.
I want to talk to you about this report.
The Rhine flows between France and Germany.
Have you ever been to an opera?
Which hat do you want to buy?
She stopped singing the song.
Tom hid under the bed with the cat.
I wish I had more friends.
We just want to be happy.
You need to exercise more.
How long do you plan to stay in this country?
Leave me alone.
Why do you want that anyway?
Don't be crude.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
You're the one who trained me.
Why don't you loosen up?
I've never had a friend like you before.
I will shoot him.
I had to get some help.
Did you hear all that?
I borrowed this comic book from his sister.
I'm in trouble now.
I hate myself sometimes.
OK, I think I get it.
We found Tom's umbrella.
He is strong as a horse.
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
I'd like to cash a travelers' check.
Don't tell me what to say.
I hope I can manage to make both ends meet.
It was the best party ever.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
I apologize if I offended you.
This one is all yours.
I appreciate all your help.
I'd like to have my hair trimmed.
I never promised you anything.
Leave my things alone.
He is a man who loves ceremonies.
I couldn't let you do that.
How do you happen to know Tom?
Would you like me to massage your shoulders?
Tom hasn't seen Mary since October.
This surprised many people.
It was unlocked.
I saw a dog crossing the street.
Do you know anyone who needs a job?
Can I speak to you?
He was holding a pen in his hand.
I was the only woman.
I just want to be clear.
Tom has been living in Boston since he graduated from college.
I think it's time for me to give her a ride home.
My son can tell time.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
What was it?
We should not have done that. It was wrong.
You're talkative.
Have you called the boss already?
I called him up.
Please write it down.
My cough is getting worse.
Let me take you to someplace where you'll be safe.
Don't tell the others, OK?
Look at that koala over there.
We also went to the temple.
From my point of view, Australia is one of the best countries in the world.
Tom is Mary's fiancé.
He treats his employees well.
Never tell a lie again.
Don't bother to answer this letter.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
What do you regret most?
Even Tom lied.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
Tom paid for it.
I myself have never seen a UFO.
If I were you, I would follow his advice.
Where shall we eat tonight?
I'm not sure that you're ready.
That bridge isn't long.
How do I do that?
Speaking English isn't easy.
Don't ask me that again.
Tom doesn't seem busy.
Let's ask.
The new model is expected to be put on the market early next year.
I will see him at the first opportunity.
We went to the café that I told you about.
We'll keep in touch.
He will run for mayor.
This theory consists of three parts.
They're headed this way.
The cellar is ugly, dark, and stinky.
Health is more important than wealth.
I met Tom when I was thirteen.
Hurry up, or you will miss the train.
We need someone to keep an eye on our baby while we are away.
It's not like you're going to get arrested or anything.
You're bright.
All your problems have been solved.
You're very good.
I'll rip your head off!
What do you think of his suggestion?
You'll be asked why you want to be a teacher.
He's intimidated by beautiful women.
He is complaining about something or other all the time.
That's why I called you.
How long have you been in this town?
I waited for him for an hour.
It was worth every penny.
You are the one.
I often meditate on the meaning of life.
I'm taking a walk in a park.
Why don't you go talk to him?
Nobody cares for me.
Unlock the door.
Tom didn't know that.
They have no money.
How big is your house?
Half of the melons were eaten.
That would take time.
Did Tom talk to you about his plans for next weekend?
What do you feel like doing tonight?
I feel much safer now.
I think Tom is dependable.
Everybody wants recognition.
I have written down his phone number.
You're so impatient.
The plot twists were predictable.
I never saw you.
You have a decision to make.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
We all speak English.
I don't want to do your dirty work.
I gave orders I was to be left alone.
You shouldn't be in here.
Don't worry about it!
There's a rumor going around.
I wrote him to ask why.
I like the way you look.
In the Southern region, sales were up 47 percent.
I'd like to go with you.
I must be going deaf.
They love their children.
I don't know why I bother with you.
I promise you I'll look after you.
They could still be here.
Did you bring the book?
I've got a plastic cup.
This place has a mysterious atmosphere to it.
It is difficult for me to skate.
Get up early, and you'll be in time.
You're the only one I think about.
He looks good for his age.
He spoke of the people and the things that he had seen during his trip.
You're going to have to do better than that.
That love affair is a family secret.
I did it for you.
You can't drink the water here.
We have a bit of time now.
She had no brother.
What did it feel like?
Don't blame me for this.
My grandfather was part Indian.
I've never seen a whale that big.
It's very hard to see yourself as others see you.
I'm not rich enough to buy that.
Tom smelled funny.
I want you to have my land after I die.
Tom's broken arm took several weeks to heal.
He declined their invitation.
Tom and Mary broke up last week.
Tom gave me several books.
Tom died at a very old age.
I can't just leave. I have to tell the boss I'm leaving.
I'm thinking of going to Germany to study medicine.
The rule should be revised.
I just kind of want to be alone right now.
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be singled out for a full body search.
I might not be at tonight's party.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Tom.
This book is selling like hotcakes.
I could never forgive myself if I did that.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't speak French.
Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.
It's an extreme case.
Tom is really overweight, isn't he?
I think it'd be great if you could come.
Let's proceed with the items on the agenda.
You're very direct.
He has to stay in bed.
Someone broke the window.
I could use some sleep.
He is accustomed to the work.
He leaped over the shallow ditch.
I checked twice to make certain we hadn't made any mistakes.
Don't take any chances.
They've all gone crazy.
I want you to go upstairs.
You say you don't want to get your hands dirty.
I don't care how much it costs. I'm going to buy it anyway.
Please sit here.
I let you down.
I hope Tom is right.
I'm glad that you'll come.
Does she speak French?
I have been busy for two days.
It costs $100 a night not counting tax.
You're in pain, aren't you?
I want to look different.
I can't tell him apart from his brother.
I can read your mind.
She is wiser than I am.
Tom believed that John was his brother.
Thanks for your report.
He ignored me.
It's outdated.
Never mind what happened.
We leave in half an hour.
We received instructions on how to make a bamboo basket.
Why are you so pale today?
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
Tom drank the water that he was given.
I need a Japanese-English dictionary.
I like to laugh.
I'm not the only one who's planning to do that.
Thousands of people gathered there.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
Hi! How are you?
I worked really hard on this.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
Juggling is actually a lot easier than it looks.
Most of the dogs are alive.
I'm afraid this data is not reliable.
He is Italian by birth.
Do you spend most of your time worrying about things that don't matter so much?
Tom is three inches taller than Mary.
I forgot to call him today.
I can do this with you or without you.
The Titanic sank on her maiden voyage. She was a large ship.
She's smartly dressed.
Does that make you angry?
I don't think I can eat this.
That mattress needs to be aired out.
A smell of lilies filled the room.
You should not despise a man because he is poor.
Isn't that enough for you?
The teacher and I sat down face to face.
His childhood was harsh.
My room is three times as large as yours.
I have things to attend to elsewhere.
I used to take a walk in the morning.
I would like to go to France.
I have no idea how I got here.
Is this fake?
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
Tom is a compulsive hoarder.
That's what the boss wants.
That is your book.
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was born in a log cabin in Kentucky.
Who is playing the piano?
Please drop me off at the station.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
I hate my computer.
You look smart.
Mumps is an infectious disease.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
I'm observant.
What are they made of?
This book is interesting.
I got you something to eat.
I got up very early this morning.
I think you deserve more than this.
Your pitching is far superior to mine.
Both of them started laughing.
I feel really confident.
Is it true that you gamble?
We heard screaming outside.
They used a high-speed camera.
Money makes the world go round.
I'm not really angry.
I knew it was unhealthy.
Take the bags upstairs.
You look European.
The students could not answer.
I parked on the street in front of your house.
One's teachers should be treated with respect.
What is for dessert?
Have you ever been lonely?
Go and help your brother.
You had me fooled.
I meet him at the club from time to time.
What happens next?
I ate a donut.
My friend was arrested for speeding.
Do you want in or not?
Tom hated his mother.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
He is American.
Even if he doesn't come, we'll have to begin.
Who's to say it's not what's supposed to happen?
You can fix all this.
You look upset.
Above all things, we must not be selfish.
He is not very good at mathematics.
How could it not bother you?
I think you've got what I need.
He has small feet.
Let me know what you want to do.
Tom knows Mary can't speak French.
I know that you're very angry.
I'm available now.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
This was your idea.
We've all done things we're not proud of.
I have no idea of what to expect.
They are arguing.
Take a bite.
I can open the window.
She explained to him why she was late.
This is not funny.
I really can't figure it out.
Do you want to learn to drive?
What smells so good?
You don't have the guts.
I don't want to listen to you.
Many children stay after school for club activities.
All our attempts were in vain.
I've already fed the baby.
They're in trouble.
Tom is pretty decisive.
The job of a driver is not as easy as it looks.
Are you talking to me?
Are you a student here?
Tom wanted to cry.
I'll visit you at your office tomorrow.
I'm not sure if he saw it.
Tom didn't want Mary to move to Boston.
I'd like to find somebody to take care of my children.
I'll babysit your kids for you.
I never look at this picture without thinking of those happy days.
I'm a stranger here myself.
Is it more fun being a child or an adult?
I have gotten him into trouble.
Do you understand the difficulty of my job?
I don't remember you at all.
Tom is kind of creepy.
What do you believe now?
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
We're happy.
We should probably ask Tom first.
Are you pulling my leg?
Are you still jealous?
I don't see how that could be possible.
A horse passed my house.
They live in a house.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
Are ghosts real?
And who did you learn that from?
Mother was very busy most of the time.
Tom rode the roller coaster.
I figured you'd probably never want to see me again.
Having a telephone helped her find more clients.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
He's such a sweetheart.
She stared him in the face.
Could you make it a little shorter for me?
We couldn't agree on anything.
Do you have any idea how important your test grades are?
Do fish sleep?
I was born in Tokyo on the eighth of January in 1950.
We heard the sound of gunshots.
You are the one.
We're unprejudiced.
We're contented.
Does someone here speak French?
It appears to me that you are right.
I heard that a woman stabbed a man for eating her lunch.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
I didn't do it for you.
She is expecting a baby in June.
I want to make this quick.
I saw you.
Are you having any difficulty doing that?
No, I don't want to.
Don't look at me!
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
I don't remember his name.
Let's stop at the next gas station.
He took a notebook out.
They're very close friends.
Please step inside.
He works too slowly to be helpful to us.
Nobody came to the party.
He has a butler and a cook.
I told her that if I could be of any use I would be glad to help.
Fish is an important food source for people.
The two teams fought very hard.
Tom hardly ever wears a tie.
I've never seen anything like that.
Tom didn't choose the same thing Mary did.
These are probably yours.
I messed up.
You're unambitious.
I remember the first time we met.
I don't know how to reach you.
What do you feel like eating?
Anybody in here?
They got the short end of the stick.
Air is invisible.
I don't care for that sort of thing.
Have a safe journey.
You said you were happy.
Aren't you a little young to be doing this?
Please tell me how you plan to do that.
She decided to go.
This river is very dangerous to swim in.
It was given to me by the Queen herself.
You need a joystick.
Wipe your face clean.
She picked up the phone.
I have no interest whatsoever in eating English food.
Have you got it yet?
Have you ever been hypnotized?
I rewrote my report.
How did I let this happen?
The factory uses many complicated machines.
Don't let me catch you doing anything like this again.
She starts her job at seven o'clock.
"You're a good guitarist." "I'd like to think I am."
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
I just knew I couldn't do that.
Wires carry electricity.
He threw everything out of the boat.
The clock isn't working.
You're out of booze.
Use it or lose it.
Thanks for supporting me.
He speaks English better than I do.
I know your roommate.
I appreciate your directness.
He rejected our offer.
I think we'll be safe here.
Sewing is manual work.
You seem very nervous this morning.
She tied him to the chair.
Tom was my cellmate.
I would rather not go there alone.
I looked in the window.
We understand you perfectly.
When did you last see my brother?
I'm obviously very disappointed.
Tom tells me you're his assistant.
They arrived too soon.
Tom, are you okay?
My aunt grows tomatoes in her garden.
You're poisoning me.
There were boxes everywhere.
This room is very warm.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I can't help feeling something's not quite right.
Your paintings are beautiful.
What time do you want me to pick you up?
The town where I was born is beautiful.
They are watching.
Something had to be done.
I want to know what you're doing here.
Although the sun was out, it was cold.
Last night I threw up.
I don't like meat.
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
I speak French.
We're out of options.
I think you're contradicting yourself.
Bring along your friend.
I can't bear the noise any longer.
Please come see me tomorrow.
She didn't intend to let him drive.
That could've hit me.
What's troubling you?
What do you think they'll do?
Don't believe anything they say.
She didn't press him for an explanation.
A glass of water will make you feel better.
Everybody knows that two and two make four.
Please take my advice.
Do you like surprises?
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Have you ever eaten alone in a restaurant?
I'm glad I hired you.
When was this book published?
Please throw the ball.
They were speaking in a Southern dialect.
We'll fight.
The criticism of the actor's performance was just.
Are you so stupid that you can't see it?
Let me help you put on your coat.
That bicycle is too small for you.
I didn't buy them.
Just leave me alone.
When I was a child, I was spanked if I did something wrong.
Stop flirting with me.
Forty people can't fit in here.
I cannot follow you.
You're wonderful.
The room is covered with dust.
They're in trouble.
Turn it up.
Am I in love?
Give that book back to me.
I'm here and ready.
Tell Tom what Mary told you.
What does that cost?
I don't know what I'm going to tell Tom.
Can we have a moment alone?
He was expelled from school.
Space travel was thought to be impossible.
Do you mind if I take my shirt off?
Don't show off.
What is the theme of his latest novel?
I guess I'm spoiled.
You are taller than me.
Tell me what Tom took with him.
Should I continue?
I was disappointed in my son.
I got lost in the woods.
The day is almost over.
Read the article on page two.
Tom wasn't ready to accept Mary's love or friendship.
Where did you find that strange thing?
The children were so noisy that I couldn't study.
I don't feel like doing anything today.
Tom filled the bucket with ice.
You must go up the hill.
He who knows the most often says the least.
Here we are!
You're right about that.
Tom's family showed a video of his life at his funeral.
Why don't you take the day off?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Come into the room.
Have they spotted you?
You're good.
I'd say you're jealous.
I'd like to speak to your manager.
They live downstairs.
Is the customer always right?
What kind of tattoo do you want?
Would you forgive me?
There's something I need to tell you before you leave.
Is she single or married?
You've barely said a word all night.
Have you spoken to Tom?
The cost of gasoline keeps on going up.
He doesn't tolerate that type of behaviour.
I wish you could have come with me.
I'd like to be alone now.
Don't you think Tom will be able to do that?
Before going to France, my son is going to study French.
You don't have to lie.
Do you have any news at all?
I'll check with you later.
I walk across that bridge every morning on the way to school.
He got the first prize.
We'll never catch Tom.
I want to come.
I'm not the kind of person that you think I am.
We stayed at our uncle's.
That's what you should do.
Tom was the one who took this picture.
You're very observant.

I hate being alone this time of year.
You don't have to apologize.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
We've decided to remain silent.
I have some numbness in my left hand.
I'm already married.
I'm not one of your soldiers.
I wanted to talk to them face to face.
I know you can make it.
What a nice thing to say!
I don't mind getting up at six.
You're too tense.
Why did you have to go snooping around?
I don't know how to thank you.
I just said I didn't want to talk about it.
I work in a hospital laboratory.
They all need attention.
How's your old lady doing?
Where was your daughter?
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to spend her summer vacation.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
He walks his dog every morning.
Our army attacked the kingdom.
Hey, thanks for everything.
Both Tom and Mary work as models.
We went to the park to take pictures.
Look before you leap.
Don't tell anybody.
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
You must take his age into account.
I thought you were going to stay home.
Can Tom read and write Japanese?
You chose a good one.
Why don't you look for a job?
I caught him in the act.
Is that a threat?
Here I come.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
You shouldn't be afraid of the future.
I woke you up.
He always leaves the window open while he sleeps.
Tom's workstation is usually tidier than Mary's.
Not every question deserves an answer.
When was the last time that you did something for the first time?
Do you study every day?
You're a traitor.
We had fun with them.
She couldn't afford it.
He ran through the streets naked.
A light bulb gives light.
I almost always win.
It's gorgeous.
It's considered to be an important matter.
I don't care about my reputation.
We're going to try to get you full custody.
Do you need a few minutes?
Frankly speaking, I don't like you.
What kind of work do you do?
Don't touch my car.
I'm not the one who makes the rules.
We are happy to have you join our team.
To learn a foreign language requires a lot of time.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
Which way are you going?
I don't understand what this means at all.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
You should get checked by a doctor.
Tom has been beaten up pretty badly.
Is someone knocking on the door?
Put it down.
In a court of fowls, the cockroach never wins his case.
That really isn't what I meant.
Let's do this properly.
Have you gotten over your cold yet?
Do you have a school uniform?
We went to the beach.
I can't go with you.
You're courteous.
Twelve years old is old for a dog.
She kept smiling all the time.
Why are you angry with him?
Tom works part-time.
A big earthquake occurred in India yesterday.
I like swimming.
I hope he will get better.
Tom has allergies.
I'll be back in just a second.
You gotta get more organized.
Learning French takes time.
He is either drunk or mad.
I fixed the car yesterday.
I've ordered you a beer.
Why don't you trust me?
What did you do with that?
She gave him everything she owned.
We all know it.
Well, Tom, you were right.
Don't use that word.
Do you know something I don't know?
Could you please tell me who you are?
You've lost your marbles.
The man was given a life sentence.
Have you checked the engine?
I told you not to call me on weekends.
I don't have an alibi for Monday night.
May I call on you today?
I thought you'd want to know.
She married him last year.
No one is working here today, except Tom.
Will you keep my valuables for me, please?
She looked excited.
I'd like to help if I can.
It's undamaged.
He's had some very good results lately.
We've got our own way of doing things.
Why don't you run along?
Oh my gosh! You're the last person I expected to meet in a situation like this.
She appears to have been rich.
My wife is a doctor.
I moved out of my parent's house to live on my own.
Tom caused quite a lot of trouble.
I told Tom about my past.
Women talk nonstop.
I can't trust you anymore.
Eat your spinach.
That's what I thought you meant.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
Tom says he won't get married to Mary.
I have two brothers.
I want to watch you dance.
This building is near completion.
Tell them what you're doing here.
He talks a lot.
I'm sorry, but you need to leave.
I must leave tomorrow morning.
I've been gone for a long time.
I have to replace the radio's battery.
He has all kinds of books.
Call an ambulance.
Anybody here?
May I come in?
You're too drunk to drive.
They invited them to dinner.
You're crafty.
Would you please quit asking me that?
We can't do this again.
When I grow up I want to be just like you.
I don't belong here.
I made a promise.
It's natural for you to think so.
I remember her.
Thanks a lot for your help.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
He's coming.
My father has never been sick in his life.
What has become of him?
I didn't think anything of it.
Where could they be?
You're very wise.
She works for French intelligence.
My parents won't let me have a dog.
I have to take a bus to go anywhere.
Can you lend me your bicycle?
Don't do anything you don't want to do.
I asked him his name.
At last, you've hit the nail on the head!
Do you have a fever?
I'd like you to meet my wife.
I need to sleep a little.
Would you do something for me?
Take a closer look.
I've made up my mind.
I will probably get up early tomorrow.
Tom doesn't know French.
Can you climb up that tree?
You're very good.
Sorry, I must have dialed the wrong number.
I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
You've made that clear.
She is always neatly dressed.
We all like you.
I just wanted to make that clear.
There was no one about.
You're safe.
You shouldn't let people use you like that.
I want this garbage out of here.
Reckless driving will lead to an accident.
Calculate how much money we will need next year.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be punished.
Please turn off the radio and turn on the TV.
What a big boy he is!
They didn't obey their parents.
Did you go to the doctor?
This school was founded in 1650.
You didn't have to leave.
I hate moving.
Have you sold it yet?
Let's study French.
I didn't vote for anyone.
Do you mind if I go?
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Let's take a 10 minute break.
Have you ever kissed another guy?
I want you to be my manager.
I don't have any money.
Isn't one of you enough?
The knife is dull.
She's pleased with her new dress.
It is Tom's ambition to go to the moon.
Her mother started screaming.
He searched all day for the letter.
Stop right there, please.
I am through with my work.
They look bored.
I want to know who sent you.
My TV set is almost 15 years old, but it still has a good picture.
How much should I feed my dog?
I think we can do that.
He caught a large trout.
What did you do with that?
It was not until yesterday that I learned the truth.
I wonder why people always want to know the truth.
She gave birth to a pretty baby girl last week.
I can't believe this is all happening.
Why does Tom want to hurt me?
He thought of a good solution.
The tire leaks air.
Tom stood in line.
Do you mind if I smoke here?
It's true that Americans love pizza.
He was raised by his grandparents.
Don't grow up to be like me.
These are my sister's magazines.
Who is this guy?
The cottage was clean and tidy.
How do you know so much about it?
I can tell you're upset.
That's a question we're all asking ourselves.
Wake up.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
Did you finish your homework?
Let go of the rope.
This will keep you warm.
Would you like something to eat?
You shouldn't be impatient with children.
I visited Rome for the first time in my life.
We have to get you to the hospital.
I don't believe that.
We were looking for you.
You're funny.
You're really annoying.
You've found it.
You must be back before ten.
I think Tom is sleeping.
How did you hear about us?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Stock prices fell sharply.
She deserved it.
I'm sorry, but I can't answer right away.
The scientists looked at tree-ring data.
Are you no longer in pain?
I thought it might be nice for us to spend some time together.
I don't care if you're busy. Please help me now.
I thought nothing of it.
He always comes here at this time.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
That is a blue house.
I think Tom is right.
Tell Tom you can't do it.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
These scissors are new.
I'm too old for you.
There are too many of them.
I was as surprised as you.
I just wanted to write songs.
The tree in front of the library was struck by lightning.
Just try it out.
Let's all take a deep breath.
She really got on my nerves.
Don't forget to charge your cell phone.
Are we on speakerphone?
This is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
You're free.
He denied that he knew that man.
Look at that tall building.
I just don't think this is funny.
No matter how much you try to convince people that chocolate is vanilla, it'll still be chocolate, even though you may manage to convince yourself and a few others that it's vanilla.
The town was deserted.
I love the people in this town.
Don't be so lazy.
Keep your eyes open.
We'll have to postpone the meeting.
This could be a mistake.
Can they give you something for that?
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
I hope you're not offended.
Have you already had breakfast?
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
My mother looks young for her age.
I know you must be afraid.
My sister hit the jackpot!
I like seafood.
Aren't they adorable?
Stop staring at me.
She complained that the picture was too revealing.
Isn't that exciting?
Hello, girls.
Why are you sweating so much?
Do not be so critical.
You're alone, aren't you?
Can we just drop it?
I'm just looking around.
We were struck dumb with astonishment.
Cockfighting is banned in many countries.
He doesn't have a sister.
Who can blame you?
I talked to the girl you told me about.
You look busy.
No one told me.
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
I always knew you were a nice guy.
He is dead drunk.
I could barely contain my excitement.
Is it yours?
Are you following me?
Are you sure that you want to go there?
There's something I have to ask you.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
She advised him not to buy a used car.
I outwitted him.
He is a scientist who is respected by everybody.
This bread is really delicious. Where did you buy it?
I would love to come with you all, but I don't have any money.
Have you been here all day?
I don't think I can eat this.
He wants to kill me.
Is his pulse regular?
Roll down your window.
I will do whatever you tell me to do.
The Murais have been married for ten years.
I don't know who's involved.
Don't approach the dog.
I didn't know whether I wanted to go to university.
He lives as if he were a millionaire.
Tom lives on the same street as me.
She knew the teen.
Tom tightened the knot.
I like playing the piano.
Tom made himself something to eat.
It took me several hours to write it.
I prefer to work alone.
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
A holiday this summer is out of the question.
It's just how things work.
He has a hard time remembering names.
You understand this, don't you?
Is Tom living in Boston?
Do you believe in reincarnation?
It's no trouble at all.
Where is the toothpaste?
Go on without me.
He gathered the courage to decline the offer.
This is what happens when you don't pay attention to what you're doing.
Does anybody else feel that?
Do you think I'm crazy?
He got out of the habit of smoking.
You aren't invited.
He went to the library.
That building must be on fire.
What flower do you like best?
Because of the typhoon, the school was closed.
I never saw such a woman.
I do think that Tom is dangerous.
I pulled an all-nighter preparing for the exam.
You're very rude.
You won't have your way.
I never thought it could happen to me.
You didn't make it clear.
Tom asked Mary some questions, but she refused to answer them.
Do you think students are given enough time to eat lunch?
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
Your daughter overheard us talking.
I don't care why you're late.
I'm ordering you to leave immediately.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Tom greeted Mary with a smile.
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
I wish I could do the same.
Give me your money!
I'm sure that I'm right.
Tom started running.
You're too loud.
I have a big nose.
It was yesterday that he went there.
Show them to me.
It never occurred to him that she would get angry.
They said he was still weak from a recent sickness.
I'm not done.
I won't make the same mistake next time.
He was not able to marry her.
Does this book belong to you?
History is not his major subject.
They did not have enough gold.
Tom wears the same color clothes every day.
He disguised himself as a woman.
I smelled bacon.
We have plenty of time to do that.
He told me that he would visit Nara next month.
I convinced everyone.
Tom can't hurt me.
I work for a shipping company.
I forgot to tell you when to come.
I ran into a deer.
I need to ask you for a little favor.
Our whole case hinges on whether the government's actions were constitutional or not.
Everyone's in position.
Are you hurt?
That cannot be denied.
That makes perfect sense to me.
I made fun of him.
I don't really understand this.
I'm retired.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
She handed me a postcard.
Almost no one believed him.
I have too many things on my mind these days.
His wife's a friend of mine.
I don't need your help.
I inspired my students to work harder.
He threw a rock into the pond.
She pointed at him.
Can I see this?
The two sisters lived very peacefully.
Tell them what happened.
I require advice.
I will go on foot.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
You're in the right place.
What time does this train reach Yokohama?
Tom will always be here for you.
Stop being so nice.
Don't say a word to me.
We are decorating the conference room.
The more you learn, the more you want to.
This painting has already been sold.
His voice carries very well.
Wash your hands before you handle the food.
I didn't mean to pry.
Why don't you talk to me about it?
I will never forget seeing you.
She really ate too much.
I didn't want you to make a fuss.
Are you ready for Christmas?
You're not listening to me.
He always leaves the window open while he sleeps.
I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor.
You can't just leave me here to die.
I hate spiders.
She is very pretty.
I'm resilient.
The house was in flames.
I'm going downtown.
Tom became more and more handsome as he grew older.
I learned to cook from my mother.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I thought I recognized you.
Don't you have work today?
I'd like to sit further back.
Tom told me he's getting married.
I'm glad you're all right.
What time do you go home?
He can swim like a fish.
Didn't you go out?
Do you remember what she said?
Can you see it?
What do you want to eat?
I have looked for it up and down.
He knows how to swim.
I don't have time.
I found the key I was looking for.
Do you think that dress suits her?
My girlfriend was crying.
May I sit next to you?
That old man is a fussy eater.
We're uninsured.
You're three years older than Tom.
Go two blocks and turn left.
It makes me nervous.
I put it in your room.
She has always lived in Otaru.
It's not uncommon for people to give fake personal information when registering to use websites.
There's something strange here.
I don't know who that man is.
He came out on top.
Have you done this before?
Either stop talking or say something worth hearing.
It's fine today.
We'll talk about that soon.
I thought I'd lost you.
We're not open.
Tom is familiar with this area.
He drew some vertical lines on the paper.
I have a lot of homework.
Check these out.
You've never told me that before.
I didn't even know that my car had been stolen.
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
We have another ten miles to walk before sunset.
Whatever you do, don't let Tom help you.
The rich are different from you and me.
I hope so.
She accused him of having lied to her.
I'm free every day but Monday.
The wind gradually died down.
According to the paper, there was a big fire in Boston.
I hope you're not planning to do that today.
I hate to put you through this.
He lost his eyesight.
What I told you about him also holds good for his brother.
That's what's going to happen.
Pink is not just for girls.
He told me that she was sick.
Every spring the river floods here.
You can't blame her for not knowing what she hasn't been taught.
I have a great idea.
You aren't a spy, are you?
Tom is a dreamer.
He showed a lot of skill.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
I broke up with Tom.
What woke you up?
I have no home to return to.
We're partners.
I feel like being alone.
My sister has been studying in her room since this morning.
I took my shoes off.
Bring me today's paper, please.
I fully understand your concerns.
I waited for a bus to come.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
I didn't even notice you.
I want to ask you a big favor.
They come from the same town.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
You'll be fine.
The sun is shining in the sky.
Excuse me, what is the name of this place?
You're the last hope for humanity.
You should stay away from Tom.
Tom amazes me at times.
All graduates are invited.
That guy has a screw loose!
I'm very fortunate.
They got a warm reception.
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
The eagle is about to land.
See you soon!
Neither is true.
I don't know how much money we've got.
There is almost no violence in that city.
That might be fun.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
Where did you find it, at school or at home?
My parents know about it.
Money influences everything.
Every seat was full.
It's unlikely that that movie will make a lot of money.
My body itches all over.
They agreed to start early.
What is he like?
We still have some work to do.
I think we're going to stay for another day.
She went with him to the zoo.
The only difference between a bad cook and a poisoner is the intent.
I wouldn't do that.
I want to see the scene in slow motion.
He's been waiting here for a long time.
Get in the car.
I'm a natural blonde.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
There's no need to exaggerate.
They're all here.
I only have six months to live.
When's this supposed to happen?
Something weird's going on here.
Don't drink too much, okay?
Where are my clothes?
Tom explained the project to Mary.
I want to do this.
We're here with our children.
They won't allow me to do what I'm being paid to do.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful.
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
I've heard this story before.
You're all I've got.
They wouldn't have recognized Tom.
You know I don't dance.
I studied French last night.
I had him fix my watch.
I don't know where exactly.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
He's incredibly talented.
He wants to talk to you.
Is this your favorite song?
I want to come and live here.
Coffee keeps me awake.
The church is between my house and yours.
I saw you with Tom.
The delivery of the goods was delayed due to the storm.
Tom told Mary he was busy.
May I run with you?
She accused me of telling a lie.
"How are you?" "I am fine, thank you."
Try not to yawn.
Tell us what's going on.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
Why don't we go and see a movie?
He always sings while taking a shower.
That's exactly what I needed.
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen.
You can go if you want to.
That worked.
We're getting out of here.
Can you imagine what our lives would be like without electricity?
He's a sweet guy.
Tom isn't wearing a red tie.
You're double-parked.
Can you tell me the exact time, please?
I never saw Tom before today.
She gave him money as well as food.
Let's wait here.
I'm addicted.
You and I are good friends.
Do you find the work too hard?
I could hear everything.
I saw Tom hitting Mary.
You weren't serious, were you?
But very soon, the battle would become fierce.
What'll tomorrow's weather be like?
Let me smell your breath.
Tom was so hungry that he ate dog food.
I was threatened.
This is by far the most interesting of all his novels.
Which floor do you live on?
Don't hesitate to ask if you want anything.
Country life is very peaceful in comparison with city life.
Are you all right?
How could you say such a thing?
Could I use your phone?
Our eyes take time to adjust to the darkness.
He's going to sit here.
I don't know how to deal with this.
I need you to come with me.
You're cantankerous.
What is your blood type?
You'd better not see her now.
It's a risk we'll have to take.
According to this magazine, my favorite actress will marry a jazz musician next spring.
She held him like mother gorillas hold their babies.
I love a challenge.
I'm in way over my head.
They can't get out.
Chivalry isn't dead.
I saw his car make a turn to the right.
I lied to you the other night.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
He is British.
I'll remember you forever.
I'll understand if you don't want to go there with me.
I just hope it's not too late.
That was rather good, wasn't it?
He doesn't allow interruptions.
Don't ever lie to me again.
I don't know if Tom still lives in Boston.
You can't put off doing that any longer.
I'm proud of myself.
You wanted this, didn't you?
I'm strongly opposed to a compromise.
That's what the boss wants.
You didn't let me answer.
You can come with us.
Where do you get off telling me anything?
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
You should prepare for the future.
Sit down and take it easy for a while.
He is a type of a person who calls a spade a spade.
He has a large basket full of flowers.
I've been looking all over for you.
In case of fire, dial 119.
The newspaper is on the table next to the window.
I also went there.
Why is she so silent?
She had a crush on him.
Get real, will you?
Please leave.
Tom lived in Boston until a few years ago.
I won't come back again.
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
I think Tom's idea is a good one.
Just pretend I'm not here.
There was a large audience in the concert hall.
Are they Japanese?
What number bus do I take to get to Waikiki?
I'll act as a guide for you.
When did you get your first tattoo?
He has an unpronounceable name.
My daughter's driving me crazy.
Say hello to your sister for me.
I don't think that'll happen again.
I got a nasty sting from a wasp.
How much are these shoes?
At last, it began to rain.
I'm not saying this is your fault.
You need to be careful.
It was pitch-black.
I want you to call it off.
You knew the answer all along.
You should have told it to me sooner.
Mary is alone in the forest.
A bunch of people told me not to eat there.
You get out only what you put in.
You're very stylish.
I read the article about you in yesterday's newspaper.
You could've killed somebody.
The plane left after a three-hour delay.
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
When did you finish writing the letter?
Don't make the same mistake again.
"We have to do this now." "There's no time."
You may meet him.
It's a lot more difficult than that.
We're not desperate yet.
Tom told me which book I should buy.
I want to be pampered.
I'm glad you asked that question.
It was quite pleasant.
They kept talking all the time.
I saw Tom yesterday and he looked sad.
He has been to France.
It's morally repugnant.
I opened one eye.
Do you think it's possible?
Old people have difficulty understanding modern technology.
Why are you so happy?
Why don't you give tennis a try?
Keep a cool head.
This place is really windy.
That girl looks like Mary.
I don't like feeling helpless.
Did they say why?
You shouldn't smoke so much.
Let me borrow that.
He visited Kyoto last year.
That dog is really ugly.
When spring comes, they dig up the fields and plant seeds.
I hope you're not alone.
There is no excuse for your actions.
Will you read this cookbook?
I walked to school.
I see a lion.
Your life is in danger.
Strictly speaking, his answer is not correct.
Tom said he isn't used to this kind of food.
I've ruined everything.
There was not enough fuel.
Are you seriously thinking about starting your own business?
Is this the dictionary you're looking for?
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
Look at my new car.
I'm all packed and ready to go.
Don't worry. We'll get the money.
I got another message from Tom today.
I'm incredibly busy.
Have you ever been arrested?
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
That's their strategy.
What's your favorite sport?
I like to talk.
Have you gotten over your cold yet?
He can speak both English and French very well.
It's your duty to finish the job.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Tom told me you were in Boston.
I was probably dreaming.
This shouldn't be happening.
I was able to find the book I was looking for.
Make your move.
Don't forget to answer his letter.
Are things OK with you?
Tom wants to be your friend.
Why is it such a big secret?
He has a large family to support.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
Keep it together, Tom.
They settled in the country.
He likes to run.
Tell Tom I love him.
They brought trouble on themselves.
What would you do in my place?
We are liable for the damage.
Nothing happens unless you make it happen.
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
No one knows his address but Tom.
I want to know what's on that train.
What else do you know?
We're close enough.
The fugitive crossed the river.
You're not allowed to eat those.
Nothing has been heard from him since he left for America.
How many days are there in a leap year?
I guess you never learned how to do this.
He is bad at driving.
He was obviously drunk.
You may still be in luck.
I think that was Tom.
Any child can answer that.
I'm strong enough.
I need space.
We agreed on a price.
Could you send up some stomach medicine?
Am I that transparent?
Tell me how to play the game.
He is off duty today.
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
May I go to bed?
She's practicing the piano day and night.
Don't you see what you've become?
I can speak neither French nor German.
I can't believe I kissed you.
I would rather not go.
It's simpler and more reliable.
Please let in some fresh air.
A watched pot never boils.
What did you call me?
I want to talk now.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius, doesn't it?
Tom is always watching TV.
Do you know who took the call?
You look a lot like someone I used to know.
The girl caught a small fish.
I have no idea what that guy is thinking.
I don't have a choice. I have to do it.
Let no one escape.
He is a really good worker.
That just happened.
It wouldn't take all that long to explain.
She will accompany me on the piano.
That will not change.
The ship is now in the harbor.
I want you to be here.
I didn't stop.
I'm still working on it.
Be discreet.
Nothing seems right.
A lot's happened while you've been away.
Can you save Tom?
Give me back my bag.
His new book is going to come out next month.
Write in the date yourself.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
There he is.
Your death will not have been in vain.
I'm strong enough.
I believe that he's happy.
I don't know what to believe anymore.
We worried a lot about you.
You're not that interesting.
Tom is going to beat you.
How many hours a day does she spend in the kitchen?
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
They are very cheerful.
He went aboard the plane.
I think we'd better wait a little longer.
A trust fund has been set up for each of the children.
You gave me your word.
I didn't think you'd show up.
It made me a little sad.
Is there anyone here?
I'm more than just a pretty face.
I know his family.
You used to love swimming.
I don't want to be tied to one company.
Don't leave town.
You saved us all.
Tom said he wanted to talk.
How about taking a walk?
Stand up straight.
I just want you to be safe.
It is not easy to be understood by everybody.
Was it a hard decision?
It's already done.
Could you say that again?
I respect your opinion.
Stop pretending that everything's okay. It's not.
This place is worth visiting twice.
I gave up smoking six months ago.
I'm pretty sure Tom has already gone home.
I don't believe you. You're always telling lies.
I don't know about the others, but as for me, I'm for it.
He's waiting for you at home.
I usually eat outside.
You have gone too far.
I don't know what happened.
Can I get you a drink?
It's your book.
It's fun to learn a foreign language.
She left her children in her aunt's care.
I'll give it back.
We can't avoid postponing our departure.
Tom likes to eat cold pizza for breakfast.
Haste makes waste.
The clock stopped.
I will drive you home.
I met your father just now.
He is influential.
I like music and English.
I can't wait to leave.
Here's something I want you to give to Tom.
I'm not sure that's suitable.
It's getting warmer day by day.
He took the job reluctantly.
Writing love letters isn't easy for me.
She decided to marry him even though her parents didn't want her to.
That's woefully inadequate.
I'd say you did well.
I just want you to know that I'm sorry.
He was stoned.
I want everyone to bring their children.
Tom died last year.
Why not try some of that white wine?
Why should we harm you?
He won the race easily.
I really don't envy you.
I am disappointed at the news.
The world champions were the Swedes.
We were all so busy then.
She remained single all her life.
I didn't catch the meaning.
I'm looking for my passport. Have you seen it?
I like reading books.
I'll leave it up to you.
Your ideas are different from mine.
The store is open from nine to six.
The mailman left a letter for her.
I could see Tokyo Tower far away.
I'm a pretty happy person.
A violent thought instantly brings violent bodily movements.
I had a raincoat on so I didn't get so wet.
Why didn't she come?
That's all I had to say.
Nobody wants to be hated.
It was just a joke. Lighten up!
Don't be scared to meet new people.
He cut him short by saying no.
I want the money you owe me and I want it now.
My suitcase is broken.
I don't want to be your boyfriend.
It's only a painting.
You have to look out for other cars when you drive.
Do you see what I mean?
The origin of the universe will probably never be explained.
Do it when you have time.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
I had to pay 5 dollars in addition.
Does Tom know why you're here?
It's a great honor to be able to meet you.
I really love her older sister a lot.
I'm fed up with him.
Can I borrow this for a while?
He sounded very tired on the phone.
They came at an inconvenient time.
How are we going to pay for that?
Tom ate more than I did.
My neighbor is crazy.
He fell asleep right away.
She advised him not to smoke.
Wait!
I'm not married anymore.
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
I like it.
This apple is sour.
I'm not qualified to do this job.
Your zipper is open.
What were you two talking about?
His eyes are blue.
We gave our word.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
Eating too much may lead to sickness.
I've never trusted you and I never will.
We haven't seen you in a while.
Tom's birthday was the day before yesterday.
Tom wasn't expecting this.
I've been asked to help out.
He is making great progress in English.
You're pathetic.
She advised him not to drink too much.
How am I supposed to eat?
In front of the university, there are some bookstores.
This decision won't make anybody happy.
A haiku is one type of poem.
He would not follow my advice.
Would you like a sandwich?
I live in comfort.
Stars were twinkling in the sky.
No one saw that.
I had to make a choice.
You can stay here as long as you don't make any noise.
It is a very sad tale.
Why's everybody so quiet?
We're going to have to make some very tough choices.
Form two lines.
We can't stay here.
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
I don't want to be involved in this affair.
Please refer to page ten.
I hate these things.
I don't like your suggestion.
You do like living dangerously.
I've been really lonely these past two weeks.
I want the fan.
I think you must be getting tired.
I don't want to see it.
She pushed him out the window.
Tom is shouting at Mary.
I dislike all of them.
The cause of the fire is not known.
I saw him three years ago.
There's something about Tom that I don't like.
Won't you come and see me this weekend?
We talked to each other for a while.
I don't know why Tom didn't want us there.
I'm glad I invited you.
It's your only shot.
Everything is extremely simple.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
I know you're upset.
Would you like to hear more?
There's no way to predict what you will dream tonight.
We depend on foreign nations for our natural resources.
You're very resourceful.
You all know what you have to do.
One third of the friends I grew up with are dead.
Stop deluding yourself.
You're the one who planted that tree.
No one will help us.
Mary is not only beautiful, she's smart, too.
I'm a little curious.
How's the job hunt?
I can lend you one if you want.
I know you see it, but are you really looking at it?
You'll make the same mistake if things continue in this way.
He seated himself beside her.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
I wonder if Tom is still alive.
Please do not buy it.
She is more wise than clever.
I work as a consultant.
I saw many people who had no clothes and I saw many clothes which had no people in them.
He inherited the house.
I'm relaxed.
Do you know where your children are?
How much money do you have?
I need the key to decode this message.
Let's hope she comes.
After that, I didn't see him again.
How did you know it was me?
Of course, I understand.
Mary helped Tom.
You're not the only Canadian here.
Don't threaten me.
I am acquainted with the custom.
She felt a bit tired.
Bad teeth often cause pain.
You're never going to believe this.
You're very clever.
I wash my face every morning.
It is clear that he is guilty.
I learned that when I was a kid.
That pasture is ten acres.
What is your name?
He eats too much.
Add 5 and 2, and you get 7.
What keeps you going?
I just want to be alone.
He wanted to meet you.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
Tom asked Mary to lend him some money.
You are very beautiful.
I like skiing very much.
He didn't say anything.
It'll snow tomorrow.
You're hiding something.
It was a heartbreaking story.
Have you seen my car keys?
You despise Tom, don't you?
Glad to see you, Tom.
She always tries something new.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
We depend on each other.
I wasn't flirting.
Wires transmit electricity.
What are you suggesting?
I ought to have made a hotel reservation earlier.
"May I park here?" "No, you can't."
A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush.
Tom needs to tell Mary what he wants.
I've got plenty more where that came from.
A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.
That guy has a screw loose!
You're too skinny.
I want to be in your life again.
How much do those things cost?
Do you need money?
Get some help, will you?
On my way home from school yesterday, I was caught in a shower.
I've messed up.
She helped him.
I'm glad you're all right again.
He's a meth addict.
You were afraid, weren't you?
I'm now officially part of this group.
It just makes no sense.
I agreed to help him in his work.
She told him that she was leaving.
Don't screw it up!
How many books do you have in your bag?
It's already nine o'clock.
You have to go.
I have to solve the problem myself.
We know it works.
He's just trying to be popular.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
His silence surprised me.
How many categories are there?
I hope it'll be fine tomorrow.
What's Tom's problem?
He got across the river.
You must do it even if you don't want to.
You look very tired.
He keeps on asking me for money.
Why don't you share it with me?
Can I speak to you in private?
I've tried to be your friend.
I'll have to think about it.
You can't erase the past.
Were they in the library yesterday?
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Breakfast is served.
That ball could've hit me.
Tom died from a drug overdose.
Tom tiptoed past his parents' bedroom.
I hope you're happy.
Please do something about it.
I'm not very good at chess.
Tom walks quickly.
What do you need?
Don't you talk back to me.
What do you think he did?
Tom broke the rules and was kicked off the team.
What's wrong with this one?
What do you plan on doing tonight?
Find somebody else.
I was the one who said we should wait.
The mayor provided me with an identity card.
You can say whatever you want to.
I forgot his address.
I get the picture.
Did you turn off the heater?
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
Do cats dream?
Is that why you're upset?
I've never sung this before.
How did you burn your hand?
I'm a cop.
I have good hearing.
We can't live another day without water.
Would you mind going over that again?
I've heard it before.
I like camels.
I was a bit emotional.
She asked me to pass her the salt.
I don't want to work today.
Who's your father?
Are you comfortable?
I am not getting involved.
That's why I'm giving it to you.
I believed you.
We can't hold the enemy off much longer.
Come alone.
You finally succeeded in getting a job.
He must have been rich.
I think jogging is good exercise.
We should place much value on the environment.
That happens sometimes.
Are you deaf?
The wind is blowing from the east.
May I have a look at your ticket?
You have to go the rest of the way without me.
He has another son.
Is that supposed to cheer me up?
Don't tell me you can't swim.
He acted behind the manager's back.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
You got it all wrong.
I would've told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
Tom was too tired to even smile at Mary.
They're just words.
The students are happy, but the teachers are not.
I thought you'd be disappointed in me.
Don't be afraid of seeing the doctor.
The falling of the Berlin Wall was truly a momentous occasion.
Listening to music is lots of fun.
I am not in the least surprised.
I didn't want to come here at all.
You're a very gifted artist.
Young people tend to take things too far.
The teacher called the students in alphabetical order.
Shall I carry your bag?
Can you lower the price?
Are you envious?
My hands and legs are swollen.
I saw a plane.
You're too trusting.
I want to follow you wherever you're going.
This morning I missed the 8:30 train by five minutes.
I liked your friends.
I'm not here for you.
Here's the best part.
I freaked out.
Did you catch the first train?
Father manages the store.
It's high time the children went to bed.
I'm just looking forward to going home.
You have been warned.
A good poker player can tell when someone's bluffing.
I think it's time for me to get a job.
The warrior is conscious of both his strength and his weakness.
Are you hurt?
Don't be afraid of change.
They looked everywhere.
That was the hard part.
I wonder why birds migrate.
My advice is to leave as soon as you can.
Tom is slowly catching up with the rest of the class.
The two of them were never to meet again.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
Your life depends on it.
It is obvious that he is right.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
I'm so mad I want to scream and break everything!
Tom fell in love with a pretty girl.
She is not wrong.
She confronted him and demanded an apology.
Tom cries every time he hears this song.
How can we be sure of his honesty?
Does that guy look familiar to you?
I want the other one.
Would you do it?
Is there anyone in the room?
I broke my glasses.
While you are about it, please make a cup of coffee for me, too.
You ruined everything.
I'm addicted.
Going out in this rain is out of the question.
It's ten minutes' walk to the station.
Oops, I did it again.
He was the last person I expected to see.
I am in favor of your proposal.
I feel cold. Would you shut the window, please?
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
It is in this room that the summit will be held.
I didn't think you would win the race.
Which book is yours?
Does your mom know?
There's no need to hurry.
English is a universal language and is used all over the world.
A lot has happened.
I'm not your brother.
How deep is Lake Biwa?
Let's play volleyball.
How many pens do you have?
I don't find that funny.
I think it's awesome.
There is a park in the middle of the city.
I don't need your advice.
Come here and help me.
Do you want to do this or not?
Between us, he is a little foolish.
Philosophers tend to have little contact with the outside world.
No sooner had she opened the door than a cat ran out.
English is not my first language.
I prefer working to doing nothing.
The Bakers have a farm up the river.
Tom is a speech therapist.
Don't say that word ever again.
I already have plans for this weekend.
Do you mind if I sit?
The law is not always fair.
Tom bought a Chinese-Japanese dictionary.
Did anybody see Tom leave?
Are you through with the newspaper?
I baked it for you.
We did that.
He went there instead of me.
The men's room is on the second floor.
I can't run as fast as he can.
Don't eat for at least three hours.
I closed the door so that they wouldn't hear us.
The baby is crawling.
Ah! Everything is clear now.
In the polls, both parties are on par.
Don't interrupt.
You were here just the other day, weren't you?
Do you have a copy?
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
I don't hear barking.
I am thinking of going to the mountains.
I read his book.
I'm the youngest in the family.
What is the name of that bird?
Tom told me to wait here.
I want to know what you see right now.
The part of an iceberg under the water is much larger than that above the water.
I think they like you.
She gained weight.
I really want to see you.
Take this medicine after meals.
Read the article.
I'm freaking out.
I left the door open.
He didn't know what to say, so he remained silent.
Tom said he found something under the couch.
Are you for real?
That accident is a very good example of what happens when you're not careful.
Is your baby sleeping?
I stayed longer than I thought I would.
Who built it?
Not only did he teach school, but he wrote novels.
It seems that I have lost my keys.
We can't fail.
A boy came running towards me.
Ten is ten percent of one hundred.
Tom laughed.
Your ideas are always appreciated.
That problem is not avoidable.
Tom took three pictures.
Do you want a few more minutes?
Does that seem fair to you?
They are expected any minute now.
We should tell Tom the truth.
Success does not come from laziness.
He is proud of being a doctor.
That applies to him too.
Do you know how fast you were going?
I want to settle down.
Tom said no.
Bring along your friend.
They've been at it for hours.
You're always singing.
I didn't say I wasn't free.
Would you like to be seated?
All the sheep were huddled together in the shade of the only tree in the paddock.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
I didn't like what I saw on TV.
He can't handle it.
You're out of time.
I cannot help thinking that my son is still alive.
There's a math test tomorrow.
I'm very impressed by your work.
Enjoy your food.
You don't look very comfortable.
I tested everything.
We're already late.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
He'll be late for the meeting.
You're disturbing the whole neighborhood.
Everybody puts me down.
He tried to hold back his anger.
He doesn't need to know.
I wonder if I should really become a teacher.
I never imagined we'd be talking about this topic today.
He likes reading books.
How do you say "love" in French?
Tom knows he's partly to blame.
Did you enjoy the movie?
He loves taking trips.
They took a walk.
Summer is almost here.
It's not necessary to come tomorrow.
I am fine.
What prevented you from coming earlier?
No one will believe him.
I've never done this kind of thing before.
Is it always hot like this?
Are all these books yours?
I own this place.
Please be careful.
We can talk.
The cat arched its back.
He was killed with a sword.
We all know Tom.
I have faith in your ability to do the right thing.
They all need attention.
The bus was two minutes early.
Tom is very handsome.
Do whatever it takes to get the job done.
Can you believe this is already happening?
Don't come unless I tell you to.
Is everything in position?
You're not very funny.
Tom drinks coffee every day.
I didn't understand much of what they were talking about.
You can't go right now.
Come in already.
This offer is available for five days.
She's been living for the last five years under an assumed name.
Normally, I stay at home on Sundays.
I'm not scared of you anymore.
You're the one who planted that tree.
You may disagree with me.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
I knew this moment would come.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else.
I haven't gotten any letters from Tom yet.
I think you're bleeding.
Why do you want to be a doctor?
This is my natural hair color.
Why don't we ask Tom's advice?
When is your school festival?
I went to see the movies yesterday.
Where's my razor?
I told you everything I knew.
We went to the beach to swim.
Few students knew his name.
They were caught in a blizzard.
Tie the horse to that tree.
She is peeling the potatoes.
How about dining out for a change?
Is something wrong?
Where's your school?
Can you speak French?
If you are not going to the concert, then neither am I.
Just say yes.
She's a violinist of some renown.
Tom didn't see the stop sign.
Am I on the right track?
The door's unlocked.
Who ate the last cookie?
I have a different opinion than yours.
English is spoken in America.
I'll be home this evening.
That coffee smells good.
I had a good time at the party.
She picked him up at the station.
She belted out tune after tune at the karaoke bar.
What style of furniture would you like?
Pinocchio had a long nose.
New Year's cards provide us with the opportunity to hear from friends and relatives.
How many cans of beer have you drunk?
My father might be at home now.
He will be having dinner with her at this time tomorrow.
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow.
The population of this village had decreased.
She was advised by him to get more exercise.
What's your favorite kind of fish?
He was learning a poem.
I gave her all the money I had.
Come and sit by me.
He works in the car industry.
You really should read it.
The car is waxed and shining.
Deeds are better than words.
I don't know anything about riding horses.
Tom can't touch his toes.
He is eager to go there.
Why should I go to school?
I want you to run to the store for me.
He has a funny name.
I'm here every night.
She was advised by him to stop smoking.
I'll leave this work to you.
I thought Tom would leave the book with Mary.
How many of these things have you made?
If you don't kill them, they'll kill you.
We need to think together about the future of Europe.
We become very shorthanded at the end of the year.
Tom changed jobs.
I'm here with a friend.
I don't know everybody in this school.
Could you please overlook it this time?
This material stretches easily.
I want to discuss this with your manager.
He thinks of everything in terms of profit.
I had an asthma attack.
It's OK to take a picture from outside.
There were a lot of murders last year.
I'll tell everyone what you did.
A dolphin is a mammal.
Didn't you know that?
This isn't a place for kids.
I'm glad to see you back.
There is no urgency.
He made no reply.
I feel awful.
What're you going to do during your summer vacation?
Do you need a ride?
Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can.
You're just different.
I must find some new friends.
Just think what it could do for you.
I didn't think you needed one.
The rebels sabotaged the railroad.
I'll assist you.
Those pants are a little too tight in the waist.
I think it's time for me to take a break.
I thought you'd eventually realize Tom didn't like you.
You're disloyal.
A child is crying somewhere.
Now's the time to apply.
Call me at six tomorrow morning.
You're nuts!
We saw you.
Tom has never lived anywhere other than Boston.
She broke into tears.
I'm lucky.
I can get us there more quickly.
I'm going to put them in a room and let them battle it out.
Your French is good.
He is a fishmonger.
She was advised by him to give up drinking.
I'd rather stay home with you.
I'm not a magician.
I see you've made a friend.
It was astonishing.
Why did you come over here?
When it rains, it pours.
Don't tell my girlfriend.
We don't want anyone getting hurt.
Look what I found in the woods.
Cats have nine lives.
Tom brought that.
Do you consider them dangerous?
The lawn needs to be watered.
He took me for everything I had.
Would you like another glass of wine?
Tom was kissed by Mary.
I cooked the pasta too long.
How was the concert?
He pointed to the tower over there.
I need everyone's help tomorrow.
If it doesn't rain soon, our garden is going to dry up.
There is no knowing when a severe earthquake will happen in Tokyo.
This system worked well until the 1840s.
He sat on the bench.
Is this the key your uncle is looking for?
Could you lend me your bicycle for a couple of days?
I had to finish what I'd started.
You have blood on your hands.
Tom was fired.
They deserve respect.
The possibilities are infinite.
I've been saying that all along.
You may park here.
Will it rain this afternoon?
That does happen occasionally.
The devil is in the details.
High tide is at 3 p.m. today.
Why don't you listen to me?
What's going on down there?
He made a thorough analysis of the problem.
I could not stop laughing.
Something strange is happening.
Don't touch me, you pig!
You found something they didn't.
How are you going to manage?
Maybe Tom will give me a job.
I paid for them.
I don't like people looking at me.
It is likely to be fine tomorrow.
It's the house specialty.
We're being watched.
I think it's going to get steadily hotter from now.
She decided not to go.
I'm always forgetting people's names.
He wants to be a tennis player when he grows up.
I needed to hear that.
You don't understand women, Tom.
They'll tell you the truth.
It's is so difficult that I have decided to give up trying.
What was your first tattoo?
I am able to swim across the river.
Hand over your weapons.
She's been in the hospital for a month.
I thought I wouldn't know the answers.
Tom's boss advanced him a week's wages.
He looks a bit tired, doesn't he?
I didn't ask you to do that.
Were you at home all morning?
He fell in love with his best friend.
I enjoyed it very much.
You're incredibly talented.
Tom left everything to me.
I had intended to go abroad.
We had a large audience.
My home is far away.
Tom certainly is an eloquent speaker.
He's cruel and heartless.
When did the accident take place?
How could something like this happen?
Speaking in English is fun.
Press this button to start the machine.
I ran into a friend on the bus.
To tell you the truth, I don't like Tom.
He described exactly what happened.
My house needs major repairs.
We can't allow Tom to do that.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I have so much work to do that I have to put off my trip.
I like my teachers.
Do your homework by yourself.
They brush their teeth twice a day.
She is all skin and bone.
I hope you'll join us.
How curious!
He is unable to concentrate on his academic work.
I had a sandwich for lunch.
Come quickly. It's urgent.
You should stay.
Leave me alone now.
I don't like this game.
They're all hungry.
I never believed it.
Tom hurried out of the building.
Did you enjoy yourself last evening?
I can't help you because I am busy.
Give me my drink.
It's a small noisy apartment, but it's where I live and I call it home.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
You'll break it if you're not careful.
She sat next to me.
I really think I should drive.
I think the box has something in it.
In general, little girls are fond of dolls.
You told me that you were here yesterday.
I suppose you have the right to know.
This science-fiction novel is very interesting.
I didn't know you had a dog.
Give me your flashlight.
He readily agreed to my proposal.
This flashlight is getting dim.
Do you remember us?
Tom's not here.
Cuban cigars are among the best in the world.
When will it begin?
He was listening to music in his room.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
The result was disappointing.
I need help painting the fence.
Don't touch my camera.
Air the futon.
She looks odd in those clothes.
Tom looks dazed.
I called you.
You are blinded by love.
I like it very much.
Are you still awake?
I'm pleased with their performance.
My parents made me go there.
You must not say it.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
It's exciting.
You don't have to apologize.
You were there, too.
A stranger came up to me and asked the way.
Thanks for your contribution.
What's the minimum wage in Australia?
I think we're done.
Do you know what they want?
I know only this.
The girl went to school in spite of her illness.
I was excited.
I want my children to reach their full potential.
What does this sentence mean?
His room was brightly lit.
I'm glad to have this opportunity to work with you.
How can you be so sure?
I succeeded because of his advice.
I want to walk.
Tom is not interested in politics.
She can hardly speak.
Don't touch the wet paint.
It was his lengthy narrative that bored me to death.
The classroom is full of teenagers. A couple of them are asleep.
Did they say what happened?
Hop in.
They're all gone.
I don't agree with him.
I didn't realize you were awake.
Tom's father is very strict.
I demand satisfaction.
I hate work.
Did you say that Tom is your friend?
That's a sign.
That's the reality.
We didn't hear you come in.
That's expensive.
I always wear an overcoat when its cold.
You can't dance, can you?
It's difficult to learn Greek.
I just got back in town.
She sat next to me.
I like this job.
Tom saw Mary crying.
She advised him to go there alone.
Are you going to kiss me?
We think we can handle that.
She has shown her room to me.
I never drink wine.
A year has twelve months.
I want to make you smile.
He hoped to succeed.
He expressed his feelings in the form of a painting.
Everyone at the party was drinking wine.
We have lots of important things to do.
He began to learn English.
He thinks he's so great.
We heard a noise.
I'm sick and tired of all this bickering.
Tom is almost thirty years old.
Please be careful.
I feel like I know you already.
It's bedtime.
He studied the way birds fly.
What should I do if Tom calls?
I will make a man of you.
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
Her one wish was to see her son again.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
She invited us to her birthday party.
I think you should go now.
Are you ready to go?
This is not my specialty.
He sprained his ankle.
I refuse to accept that.
Just promise me that you won't do anything silly.
I come here as often as I can.
The prisoner was brought before a judge.
He's in the shower.
This book is written in French.
I'll bring sandwiches.
We talked about many things.
I talk to myself.
The children shared a pizza after school.
Why did you kiss me?
That painting has started to grow on me.
Tell us a ghost story.
He told me good things about you.
Tom is usually on time and Mary is usually late.
I hate it when Tom and Mary fight.
Mary is going to have a baby.
That accident happened near his house.
Why are you picking a fight with me?
Is he breathing?
It's not supposed to happen.
Tom uses anabolic steroids.
The intersection where the accident happened is near here.
I'm excited.
I'm all for your suggestion.
Tom's alone.
We must start at the beginning.
Is this your house?
They said you were fired.
I don't believe such things exist.
He did not speak at all.
He slept with the window open.
I'm sorry about last night.
You must take care of the dog.
Just give me a little time.
Don't be afraid.
I'll keep it with me.
I am not always at home on Sundays.
Tell the truth.
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
Tom shouldn't say things like that to Mary.
This is my new video.
I like to put an ice cube into my coffee, because it's usually too hot.
You should take my advice.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee.
He has trouble remembering names.
I'm not certain Tom likes that.
We want justice.
You can't give me orders.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
He has been very busy this week.
I need to know.
May I be excused?
What makes you think that?
Can you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?
That should be prohibited.
We'll allow a 5 percent discount off list prices.
You can come at any time.
I hear you, but I don't see you.
I wasn't fast enough.
Is this legal?
Tom taught me how to cook.
I have to tell someone.
Just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Do you think I'm right?
It's time to get serious.
He cleared the roof of snow.
You'd better wait for the next bus.
I'll study harder in the future.
You won't need that.
I was right behind you.
I was unable to go outside.
What's your theory on what happened?
What's happening?
He'll never achieve anything unless he works harder.
I'm still married.
That was all Greek to me.
Now that I have a girlfriend, I'm happy.
How did you get our address?
You are a good person.
Do you recognize them?
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
This wasn't your fault.
I have no plans whatsoever.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
What's your favorite holiday activity?
Did anyone care?
I didn't go out last Sunday.
A business cycle is a recurring succession of periods of prosperity and periods of depression.
Where is the market?
I don't want to leave you.
It was here that I saw her.
I can't carry on like this.
Are we lost?
I'd like to discuss some problems we've been having.
You don't seem to understand.
I left as soon as I could.
I am a stranger here.
I think you're nuts.
Put your valuables in the safe.
It is terrible weather today.
We have something very important that we have to discuss.
Hold on a minute.
Everyone already knows anyway.
Leave this to me.
How long are you planning on staying?
My wife had a baby last week.
Would you like to go to the aquarium with me?
It'll happen.
I didn't know you then.
Last night, we went to the theater.
The gallows were already standing on the square.
He comes home almost every weekend.
I thought you were injured.
Would you do something for me?
She didn't visit anybody.
Hold your position.
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
Tom didn't get a reply.
The priest married them last Sunday.
I'll take it into consideration.
She's a true artist.
Welcome to the club.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
The pleasure is mine.
You must do exactly as I tell you.
A walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Can we talk?
Are you quite certain about it?
I'm not at all afraid.
We received an immediate answer to our letter.
We weren't all that hungry.
I'm not going to try to do that today.
The college accepted him as a student.
He got angry.
We had a rest in the shade.
Will you all be here tomorrow?
What are you snickering about?
I've never been to a professional baseball game.
You should think of their religions.
I wonder whether Tom prefers coffee or tea.
I have to go.
That could be helpful.
I was planning to call him, but changed my mind and didn't.
Even the greatest scholar can't solve that.
It's not a matter of price.
I'll go first.
I had a couple of questions, but I didn't ask them.
Don't make abrupt moves.
What exactly don't you get?
We went up the mountain by cable car.
The boy takes after his father.
What are you drinking?
He tries hard.
Just turn this handle.
He described the incident in detail.
Tom began flirting with Mary.
He loves her.
This car is very expensive.
You've got nothing to be scared of.
I need to go into town.
I've been asked to give this to you.
I swear I never showed anyone that document.
Don't make me do this.
That's all I do.
What color is your truck?
I left the window open.
He collected a lot of stamps.
Our teacher looks young for her age.
Don't be a moron.
As a result, prices rose.
She was coming down the stairs.
Do you like football?
What do you say to going swimming tomorrow?
Both of you are wrong.
I'm happy you two are friends again.
I like wearing old clothes.
She cried and cried, but nobody came to comfort her.
Got it!
I think there has been some misunderstanding here.
What's the fastest way to get to the post office?
What have you come up with?
I thought we already did that.
Did Tom leave a message?
I'll take this umbrella.
They were admiring themselves.
I like to clean my room.
She has a picture.
He said, "Let's take a walk along the river."
I think it's time for me to mow the lawn.
Tom wants Mary's approval.
He pulled open the door.
I think Tom is going to be OK.
Tom always stays at school as late as the teachers allow him to.
The blood stain can't be removed.
I have no religion.
No one knows that.
We've been warned.
Mosquitoes are perhaps one of the most dangerous animals in the world.
This time, I think you're right.
This is where I draw the line.
What's wrong with you?
Most young people have a mobile phone.
It's not that nice.
Stop the car now.
It's upstairs.
I'll buy the tickets.
Can I talk to you in private for a minute?
She looks like a teacher.
She's a born artist.
What's the weather like where you are?
It failed.
The soldier returned home on a furlough.
My mother loves me.
I'm going to put a curse on you.
I want you to leave my family alone.
I really need to be alone right now.
I caught a couple of big fish.
We chartered a bus.
I usually eat lunch with Tom two or three times a week.
I have a lawyer.
Come along with us.
I wonder if you are truly happy.
I think we should talk about this later.
Tom and Mary will get married next month.
Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
I'm learning Czech.
It's worth checking out.
The radio is too loud. Please turn the volume down.
They accused me of having broken my promise.
You'd be the one to know.
You don't look that good.
She's curious to find out who sent the flowers.
It's not done yet.
They seem surprised.
Don't expect any mercy from me.
Can you answer this riddle?
There was a lot of snow last year.
School is boring.
I lost that argument.
He is said to have made a fortune in oil.
I'll tell you my story.
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
It will heal.
I know I'll be able to do it.
It's all over for us.
I did find something.
I'd like you to answer my question.
I don't wish to anger you.
He is acquainted with the modern history of France.
He can't help you.
I don't want to do that now.
Everyone should be able to express their opinion.
Tom had to do it even though he didn't want to.
I like being on my own.
You have a big nose.
Do you know how to use this?
He went out the window.
You get used to it.
I finished last.
I want to be invited.
I am paid weekly.
Tom was a great help to me.
Thank you ever so much.
It cost me one thousand yen to get the bicycle fixed.
A white car has been tailing me for the last two miles.
My mother allowed me to go abroad.
The path was narrow.
Did you like Boston?
Have you been told where to park your car?
Tom needs to be at today's meeting.
You don't seem too sure.
My grandfather takes a walk every morning.
We have to reduce the cost to a minimum.
I haven't read any of his books.
Wait for us.
I have a wooden comb.
You're out of time.
I'm going to go buy some materials today.
What happened to him?
Life has its ups and downs.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
Do you know how to ride a horse?
I study Korean.
Have you got any ideas yet?
Quality is more important than quantity.
I don't know if I should tell you.
I had issues I had to deal with.
Her explanation concerning that matter matches yours.
I never did that.
She acknowledged that she couldn't speak French.
It will not last more than three minutes.
Where did you work before you came here?
You and I aren't like that.
I've thought of it a lot.
I think it's time for me to buy a new camera.
The hailstones were as big as tennis balls.
I stepped aside so that he could pass.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
I'm afraid for his life.
His attempt to escape was successful.
The dog barks at all strangers.
Could I do it?
The Japanese embassy has warned Japanese citizens to be careful.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
He had served as a congressman and senator.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
The negotiations failed.
I haven't decided.
If you don't miss the train, you'll get there in time.
Didn't your parents give you anything?
Don't confuse the two.
I want something cold to drink.
Why don't we do this later?
He's curious about everything.
Are you suggesting that it's beyond my comprehension?
I have many model cars.
All you have to do is push this red button.
Are they ready to talk?
I'll add the finishing touch.
What was he doing here?
He forgot that he bought her a present.
Is he still interested?
You shouldn't see her now.
I'm in a better mood now.
There wasn't even one book in the room.
She says she has no intention of having a baby until she's in her thirties.
Add a tiny pinch of salt.
He always puts himself first.
I want to talk with you.
Stop taking pictures. You look like a tourist.
I lost control.
I didn't have to wait long.
How long have you been waiting for the bus?
Even an expert driver can make a mistake.
Having worked on the farm all day long, he was completely tired out.
Roll down the window.
No one takes us seriously.
I told you I hate that shirt.
It's bulky.
She interpreted his remarks as a threat.
I don't see your point.
I was just in time for the last train.
My husband was probably drunk when he signed this.
All share the blame.
I've been busy.
That didn't help.
We went to the beach together.
I need hand lotion.
I don't see what's so great about that.
I sympathize.
There is a large parking lot in front of the station.
Everyone started laughing.
I own this store.
Did you think about our offer?
Those apples are big.
I don't care what you say. It's not going to happen!
Let's get rid of this.
I hope you're not offended.
You like cats, don't you?
He likes animals.
Please give me that book.
Make sure the door is locked.
Our teacher speaks French as well as English.
It's a matter of life and death.
I am not concerned with this affair.
A strange man came up to me and asked for money.
You heard your mother.
He received a large sum of money in compensation for his injury.
You're creepy.
We should make use of atomic energy.
I found the man I want to marry.
I hope that she listens to me.
He always wears blue shirts.
I've lived a hard life.
Where do you want to go, sir?
You have got a lot of nerve.
I'm going there alone.
Who do you trust?
I've remarried.
I have to be careful.
I stopped at the store and got some milk on my way back.
What does not kill me, makes me stronger.
He has adapted extremely well.
I could not keep the tears from my eyes.
In doing anything, you must do your best.
Contracts have already been negotiated.
It's eight-thirty.
I'm not disagreeing.
Tom put the plate of sandwiches on the table in front of Mary.
You would be safe there.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't like it.
That's really sad.
The clock is made in Switzerland.
It's started.
There is a nice park in the center of the town.
This cheese is the best I've ever tasted.
He went there in person.
It's always a pleasure to see you.
I won't forget that.
Reading books will make you smarter.
Do you play any sports?
Somehow I thought you'd say that.
Something happened here, but I don't know what.
He's kind of cute.
Where are your kids?
Tom is my son's friend.
A small gear is missing here.
I'm attracted to him.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
Let me deal with him.
You can't go out there.
She dyed her hair blonde.
He was all alone in the house.
If you are hungry, why don't you eat?
Tom is obstinate.
I know that you feel helpless.
Leave us.
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
She let the secret out.
Milk has to be kept at a relatively low temperature.
Industrialization often goes hand in hand with pollution.
That's a waste of time and money.
It's your turn to sing.
Tell Tom I'll be back.
Go grab a drink.
God bless America.
It brings me great joy.
She managed to drive a car.
They're here.
Did you talk to your new classmates yesterday?
You know what song I want to sing.
Both of my parents are not strict with me.
Tom has a difficult job.
I failed the written test.
Do you really think we can win?
Are we disturbing you?
The lake is a long way from here.
I brought reinforcements.
This tea is very good.
Maybe you don't know this, but nobody could ever take your place.
When was the last time you took the subway?
They visited us.
Girls begin puberty around the ages of ten to eleven, and boys around the ages of eleven to twelve.
This lawn mower runs on gasoline.
I think I'm right.
He got up to see if he had turned off the light in the kitchen.
Every door in the house is locked.
Tom walked to the parking lot.
You can't hate the guy.
Your bag is on my desk.
Please tell me the reason why she got angry.
This place isn't safe anymore.
I strolled along the streets to kill time.
Tom dropped his glass, but it didn't break.
If I could stay longer, I would.
Let's go now.
It looks as if it is going to rain.
Why don't you run for student council?
Keep the child away from the pond.
I can't see the movie.
You are the only one who can help me.
Take whichever one you like.
Is the job too much for you?
I guess we were happy back then.
They let me pick a present.
Let bygones be bygones.
I would appreciate a reply.
Don't make me pull the trigger.
They're not alone.
Tom was your French teacher, wasn't he?
You may come at any time tomorrow afternoon.
I was eventually released.
I have the flu.
Poaching is illegal.
I like your shoes.
May I have a look at that?
I don't like that one.
She is always at the bottom of the class.
He's as strong as a horse.
You can use my bicycle.
How did you answer Tom?
I missed you guys so much!
It was a pretty amazing experience.
Tom said he wanted to talk.
Were you at home yesterday?
I must have the wrong number.
Luckily nobody got wet.
That doesn't seem too difficult.
I can see it in your eyes.
I won't let this happen.
That's not really true.
I want to work with you.
I'm calm.
Let me know how it goes.
The Queen's crown was made of gold.
Tom isn't my brother.
He found a nice apartment for Mary.
The whole class is present once a week.
She was unable to completely give up her dream of traveling abroad.
Tom obeyed.
I was only teasing.
Tom, do you still love me?
Tom seemed to know the secret.
I didn't realize you could speak French.
I can't tell you what an honor this is.
I think Tom would like that.
There's no reason for you to fear for your safety.
I don't even want to be here.
May I have a napkin, please?
Get ready for some action.
They teased the new student.
She refused to take the money.
I can't catch my breath.
I'm not all that smart.
Don't look down on him just because he's poor.
Raisins are dried grapes.
Is it your fault or ours?
My arm is hurting badly.
No one welcomed the proposal.
I'm not sure I want to see it.
That's their problem.
We're both fine.
The cat crept toward the bird.
Is it raining right now?
Anything could happen.
You're afraid, aren't you?
Just wait a second.
It's an ambitious project.
We're not safe.
Light the candle.
A man came in and sat on the stool next to her.
Tom called in an expert.
He likes music a lot.
She will be back in less than ten minutes.
That doesn't cut the mustard.
I could never be like that.
You don't seem very pleased.
I think it's time for me to split.
That smells nice.
This is Tom's computer.
I want you to give me a job.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Tom and Mary agreed to work together on the project.
I'm making a snowman.
Bring a lunch.
The talks will deal with the problem of pollution.
We stopped for lunch at a local restaurant.
It is your right.
I'm constantly telling her to behave herself.
You can't come with us.
This is not funny anymore.
We were alone.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
There isn't anybody else.
I'm reading a book.
Tom went home with Mary.
We have been up all night.
I don't understand his reluctance to go.
Somebody's coming up the stairs.
New roads were constructed one after another.
She showed me her room.
You're very rude.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to say something like that.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
Let's see if we can find out what the matter is.
You should take a vacation.
It is becoming warmer day by day.
I'd like to build a new house.
I don't hear barking.
He's my hero.
There is no telling when they will come.
Have you ordered?
This hospital is for sale.
Where did you buy this book?
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
I can't believe we've finally finished the project.
Tom often contradicts himself.
I'll be direct.
I don't know them at all.
Get out of my room!
I'll tell Tom to stay outside.
Connect the two cables together.
As far as I know, he is a reliable man.
The terrorists released the hostages.
I don't know what to tell you.
Everybody loves a winner.
Do you want to go first?
I don't see how it can end well.
They can't hurt you.
They bought a home with a pool.
You can't eat here.
I'm doing fine.
He's your friend.
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
One of your neighbors complained.
Tom knew he was being watched.
We broke up.
You have the same camera as mine.
Tom is a machinist.
Have you tried it before?
I'm ready.
It has to be removed.
Put a lid on it!
I love your place.
The girl who is dressed in white is my fiancée.
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
He has been living in Ankara since 2006.
He is old enough to drink.
I speak a little Japanese.
I don't blame them for this.
There's a party tonight.
Could you show me how to do that?
I have been waiting for an hour and a half.
I lost my car key.
It was the most painful thing in my life.
I'm really proud of you.
Who else knows about your secret?
Do you want me to go home?
I fell in love with her at first sight.
I know what I like.
I contacted them the other day, but I was not able to get an answer.
I thought you were taller.
Do you go to school on foot every day?
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow.
I'll give him this message the moment he arrives.
This is the only tie I have.
She teaches reading and writing.
Don't tell anyone.
When I painted this picture, I was 23 years old.
I'll need you to be there.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
It cost me a lot of money to build a new house.
I just want us to stay together.
What happened to all our money?
I thought it over and decided not to go.
Your resume is very impressive.
I've heard rumors about you and Tom.
Why are you alone?
She turned her eyes away.
Bee stings can be very painful.
I thought we could eat out on the patio.
Tom cooks for us.
I asked him for his name.
I will not help you.
Tom clearly doesn't want to be there.
You're charming.
It is necessary for you to go.
Tom opened the car door to get in.
He denies having broken the window.
These are our kids.
I feel dizzy.
The sun will set soon.
She's a jealous woman.
I'd like you to take this.
I'm a light sleeper.
A crazy thing just happened to me.
I have lots of Canadian friends.
Would you do it with me?
Tom didn't get home till midnight.
Show me that list.
Sometimes I get jealous.
I will make every effort to get it.
We should save money for a rainy day.
Why don't you run for student council?
I have some food.
We are having breakfast.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
We would often talk about our future.
She was the last person I expected to see in such a place.
I read that report before lunch.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
He made her his wife.
He was in critical condition.
Tom is really fast, isn't he?
Are you still married?
I want to confess.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
I've changed my daily routine.
I like neither of them.
I didn't ask for help.
Would it be OK if I discussed it with my family?
You're very sophisticated.
She didn't let him touch her baby.
I just wanted you to accept me.
There're no guarantees.
We're retiring.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
I am taller.
I haven't seen you for ages.
She always buys milk.
I have a terrible pain.
My life is almost over.
I'm on crutches for the next month.
I just want to talk to them.
He's in danger.
I often played soccer when I was young.
You should've seen what Tom did.
She does not like him.
Put it in the closet.
Can I think about it?
Don't worry. Everything's OK.
He was having lunch when I entered the room.
Do you enjoy losing?
He never turns up without making a fuss.
She can speak three languages.
Things are not that simple.
Tom will find you.
Yours is better.
I will go if you go.
Is this your copy of the dictionary?
Are you real sure about that?
I won't bother you.
I made a fool of myself.
I feel sort of dizzy and I feel like throwing up.
Let's give Tom some privacy.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I don't like to be away too long.
He often comes late.

Will you buy me some bread, please?
He seems to have been ill for a long time.
Keep away from the fire.
You just told me not to do that.
What makes this one special?
She was surprised at the news.
These are the people who live next door.
Tom came back an hour later.
Am I wrong?
I am a bit drunk.
It could just be your imagination.
You had better go.
Are we ready to go?
Can't you see I'm busy?
I've never told anyone that before, not even my mother.
Tom could see Mary was getting very nervous.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
This is my family.
Cut that out!
How many hotels do you think there are in Boston?
It's extremely dangerous.
You're a bad liar.
Are you even trying?
That's exactly what I want to hear.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Did you like the meal?
Do you want a little cake?
Prepare yourself.
Don't touch this!
I came to see Tom.
I found this watch at the station.
Mine is the red one.
I wanted to run away with Tom.
She asked me what had become of him, but I didn't know.
I asked Tom for some help.
The dog is as good as dead.
What kind of car are you driving?
Where are you going to sleep?
Just stick around a few days and you'll come to love this place.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
Finally, I finished a painting.
I'm going to go to my room.

They said you were fired.
There is no reason for her to scold you.

Tell me how you solved the problem.
I've never cared about such things.
We gave a party in celebration of his 70th birthday.
You didn't buy that, did you?
I gave him a few books.
It's eight-thirty.
Where exactly did you go?
I started crying.
I could hear everything.
So, are you seeing anyone?
I don't know where I'd begin.
I wonder what has made him change his mind.
I know that she doesn't know who I am.
He must be the principal.

I don't need a babysitter.
I ate too much yesterday.

He did not come back before ten o'clock.
How could I forget you?
I wrote to him for quite another reason.
My feet are sore.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
Does this mean you won't be sleeping here?
I am not concerned with this.
Tom took a long drink of water.
Buy low, sell high.
He's bulked up quite a bit since he's been going to the gym.
He is at home today.
I was just angry.
What are you up to tomorrow afternoon?

Don't respond to questions marked with an X.
We'll start.
Your work has greatly improved.
You must not behave like this.
She was afraid to make a speech.

We need more time.
I made up my mind to go there.
I don't understand the meaning of this phrase.

I want an explanation and I want it now.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
We acted in good faith.
We don't share the same values.
I'm not as busy as Tom.
His teaching methods are highly unorthodox.

Am I boring you?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
You guys wait here.
How do you remember that?

Mary is very attached to the little girl.
You will soon be convinced I am right.

How do you know all that?
The mission was simple.
Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
How often do you go abroad?
Don't let that dog come near me!
I'm alive.

We're touched.
You can't be sure of that.

His voice is pleasant to listen to.
Would that really be so bad?

Give him the benefit of the doubt.
It's really sad.

Customers stopped coming to our shop.
The ice cracked under the weight.
He is very particular about his food.
How did you kill the guards?
I'm looking for my mobile phone.
What do you like about her?
Everyone changes.
I've been to Boston quite a few times.
The dog barked.
I'm afraid of drowning.
His prediction might come true.

You're the reason I came.
She pretended not to hear him yesterday.

I was very worried about her.
What's the big hurry?
You don't stand a chance.
Why don't you talk to him?
Everybody applauded.
I'm really glad you're here.
Everyone will be happy.
Fight like a man.
Which of you will go?
A lot of tourists come here.
Oh my God! What are you doing!?
What's the secret ingredient?
It was shorter than he expected.
Tom knows who we are.
I am reading a letter.
You have to get this work finished by noon.
We all do that.
He did his best only to fail again.
Did something happen?
I think Tom and John are identical twins.
What makes you think I want your help?
There's no salt.
You're too young to remember the nineties.
What is your age?
I met a friend.
Compare your answer with Tom's.
He was the first actor I had met in my life.
She won't be pleased.
I have to take the test again.
I am glad to help you.
I had this suit custom made for me.
I guess I've been too busy.
I recognised him immediately.
Since I had a slight fever, I stayed in bed.
I'll remember you forever.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
He decided not to go.
Is this a duty-free shop?
The snow melted away in a day.
I insist that we do this now.
Can you help me install this software?
No matter who comes, don't open the door.
I think we can avoid that.
I'm sorry that I didn't email you sooner.
She seems happy.
What's the emergency?
What did you do then?
Did I miss the turn?
He leads a hectic life.
Mary is a country girl.
Would you prefer a window or an aisle seat?
Go and see the doctor.
You look like a girl.
How can you even ask that question?
You know what they say.
It's really bad.
I can't imagine that.
He's fresh out of college.
Few politicians admit their mistakes.
I can't believe my eyes.
Tom is merciless.
I think you know that's not true.
Talking in the library is not allowed.
I am yours and you are mine.
Normally this would be funny.
We have no other option.
Did you find a job?
No one misses you.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
That is something you should not have said.
Please translate this into French.
Who wants jello?
I told you to stay away from my daughter.
Do you know anyone from Boston?
I'll be very discreet.
Don't be ridiculous!
He'll become a good husband.
We have an obesity problem in this country.
Has the train been delayed?
Your demands are unreasonable.
How are things at home?
He deliberately broke the glass.
Just act as if nothing has happened.
It was only a dream.
I forgot all about that.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
This one's a little harder.
No one here will betray you.
It's October the third.
We couldn't go out because of the heavy rain.
How do you prefer your eggs?
The answer was pretty astonishing.
Don't be a chicken.
He'd prefer to go on Friday.
You will obey us.
Until that day, I had never eaten dog meat.
I have a few tickets in row 15.
He speaks Chinese.
Since it's nice out, I'd like to go take a walk.
I think Tom is compassionate.
I've got to get dressed for school.
He passed his property on to his son.
We aren't that poor.
He was surprised to learn this.
Now that you are an adult, you should know better.
I remember everything you tell me.
There's a party after work.
How old do you think Tom is?
Tom used to be a heavy smoker.
Tom loves potatoes.
She gave him all the money that she had.
We're going to see Tom again.
You're still single, aren't you?
There isn't much butter left in the refrigerator.
It's a little bit dangerous.
Morality is mostly a matter of how much temptation you can withstand.
My son loves rockets.
Do you work on Monday?
That's not very reassuring.
I'll go with you.
She has done her homework.
You should look this word up.
I know who did it.
The workers are complaining about their working conditions.
Tom has a voracious appetite.
I can't believe I'm agreeing to this.
I seldom hear from him.
How did you get into the house?
Watch your toes.
My car broke down on the way.
People have a tendency to underestimate their future needs.
He's not my cousin.
A good sweat will cure a cold.
I just don't want to hurt anyone.
Can he see us?
Tom hardly ever speaks French to his mother.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened at school yesterday.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
I did my homework.
Does that mean you'll have to stay?
My hard drive is almost full.
I will go to New York next week.
These boxes are heavy.
I didn't tell you everything.
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
Can you give me a ride?
I'm sorry, but I don't speak French very well.
Her story turned out to be true.
Don't breathe a word of what I've told you to anyone.
He has no friends to advise him.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
He asked her questions.
Everything is set.
He is eager to go there.
Can you remember the first time you swam?
The bad weather's preventing me from leaving.
You'll find this lesson easy.
We're unemployed.
I thought we were happy.
How can you justify your behavior?
I know you don't love me.
I heard a noise.
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
I don't care what happened.
I bid against him.
Why is she so popular?
Tom studies hard.
Charles Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927.
The restaurant wasn't full.
Nobody can hear you.
I was always interested in art.
I was born and brought up in Tokyo.
I've locked myself out of my house.
How much am I paying you?
How's your sister today?
None of that is necessary.
Tom'll quit.
They rented the upstairs room to a student.
She was asked to convince him to get his son to paint the house.
You should learn from your mistakes.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I arrived yesterday.
I appreciate any assistance you can offer.
I received my birthday present.
Would you like to join us for dinner?
Can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant?
I did that earlier today.
We were supposed to meet at 2:30.
I went out in spite of the rain.
What were you doing that moment?
I survived.
She is always dressed in black.
Should I fill in this form now?
I'll see you again this afternoon.
She speaks loudly.
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Cut the cloth diagonally.
I'm nervous when speaking in another language.
You need to lose weight.
Where did you find the keys?
You're in love.
I'm methodical.
They were born one month apart in 1970.
Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
We must go.
The bus turned around the corner.
Tom doesn't understand you.
Your guess is wrong.
It seems that he knows everything.
We play games together.
You must be terrified.
I'm a little out of practice.
Take a deep breath.
She sat at the bar downing shot after shot of whisky.
We have enough money.
Why were you absent yesterday?
If your child drinks poison, rush him to the hospital.
You're such a flirt.
Trust is earned.
He knows my wife.
Go when you want.
Are they brothers?
You owe it to those who are dependent upon you to do this.
I'm not easily offended.
I figured you must be hungry by now.
It's a complicated subject.
She tempted him.
You'll be safe with him.
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
She is a very good teacher.
I don't have enough RAM.
You are an idiot to go out in this weather.
They celebrated his success by opening a bottle of wine.
Talk to my boss.
The cat is on the roof.
Who could do this kind of thing?
They are doctors.
He studied military history.
I have the same number of books as he has.
We heard shots in the distance.
Do you think the situation can improve?
I can see a ship on the horizon.
Tom expects to hear from Mary soon.
We did not help him, so he made it by himself.
Is there anyone else around?
We were together.
I don't believe it was an accident.
You can use my bicycle.
They can't all be full.
Give my regards to your family.
I guess I've gotten lazy.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
It serves you right.
Do you mind if I use your computer?
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
Acid acts on metals.
Do you mind if I turn off the AC?
I have a lot of work to do today.
Have you finished your work?
She put in for a raise.
I'm still waiting for Tom to pay me back the money I lent him.
Are you looking for someone?
I hate her now.
It's free.
He's fresh out of college.
I want to be an astronaut.
This is not acceptable.
She beat him to death.
They all drank.
You're not one of us, are you?
I cannot disclose any information about the informant.
Irritating, isn't it?
The boys are thirsty.
Tom is one of the richest men in the world.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
You'll do exactly as I say.
I'm not worried about Tom.
This is where the fun begins.
You're preaching to the choir.
Make sure that you arrive at seven o'clock.
You have gone too far this time.
I just want to find a cab.
I thought it'd be fun to sing a few songs together.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.
She stayed at a hotel.
I should've listened to you.
Is there a garden in front of the house?
We're on a tight schedule today.
I don't have to listen to that.
Tom lost weight very quickly.
I had been reading for an hour.
This is the boy who found your watch.
I had hoped you might say that.
I can't lend you this book.
It's another ball of wax.
I wasn't the only one who was late.
You'd better get up early.
You seem really busy this morning.
We are not Americans.
You fainted.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
I didn't think you'd be coming.
Can you ride a horse?
I've explained all of this to you before.
He treated me badly.
Some people gain weight when they stop smoking.
I don't understand and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain it once more.
Tom is arrogant.
You don't have to apologize.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
The boy got lost in the forest.
I've already finished my work.
What were you two talking about?
I need more blankets.
You can go wherever you want.
What does this image make you think of?
We've been together for a very long time.
Stop poking me on Facebook.
It is easy to add numbers using a calculator.
Camping is impossible where there is no water.
He hasn't appeared yet.
I just finished reading the book.
Stop being so nice.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
I change my underwear every day.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You must keep this machine free from dust.
He regained consciousness and was able to talk.
None of the rooms is ready.
He looks just like his father.
He can't tell what is written on the paper.
What's this commotion all about?
They knew how much danger they were in.
I love to cook.
No matter how busy you are, I think you should at least read a newspaper.
Keep to the right.
Don't run so fast.
Scary movies will frighten the children.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
I'm not a psychic.
Why are you ignoring me?
How long were you there?
He stuck to his promise.
I know someone who has never seen the ocean.
That sounds like something you would do.
Many trees fell down.
He did nothing but cry.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
I haven't eaten since breakfast and I'm very hungry.
Tom wants me to help him.
There's a restaurant here.
Don't call her now.
What kind of car do you drive?
I wasn't able to remember the title of that song.
They enjoyed themselves.
I'd like to kiss you.
Be nice to her.
She drives me mad.
I have a friend whose father is a famous novelist.
I'm going to the police station.
I just want to get this thing over with as quickly as possible.
I'm stunned.
She emerged victorious in the struggle.
That's very personal.
You and I are going together.
Could you wake me tomorrow morning at a quarter to seven, please?
I bought a house.
To tell the truth, I don't like what you're wearing.
The soldiers were ready to die for their country.
I wish I could speak French.
I got lost three times.
There is no smoke without fire.
Were there any survivors?
You should do that soon.
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
Someone tried to kill me.
When your stomach is busy, digesting a big meal your brain takes a vacation.
Leave the book where it was.
I was kidnapped.
You'll be in charge of the women working in this factory.
Don't trust anyone.
I'll keep it with me.
The US is trying to extradite a drug lord from Mexico.
What's all that racket?
I am hanging up my shirts.
She is the type men call "stunning."
She worked hard in order to save money.
I thought you might like to know who's coming over for dinner.
This river is deepest here.
Tom wanted to know what had happened.
I heard yelling.
Tom doesn't have to worry about me.
I suppose Tom told you what time he plans to arrive.
I'm not worried about him.
Do I have it right?
He lives frugally.
I suppose that's all right.
The U.S. gun ownership rate is the highest in the world.
You can count on him.
I support you one hundred percent.
It doesn't matter what I believe.
I got up to go and look outside.
The unrest lasted three days.
Could I use your pencil?
Can they see us?
Tom isn't happy at all.
I don't know what to do with it.
I know the answer.
I'm not really that thirsty.
What have you come here for?
The car has been acting strangely.
Let's stop talking and start working.
That's a good school.
He came to pick me up.
You must reboot your computer.
He was checking you out.
You remind me of your mother.
Have you seen anyone else?
I want to make sure you are who you say you are.
Do you know what the population of Boston is?
You can't put off doing that any longer.
I don't understand.
What a dope!
I live about a mile from here.
Don't expect too much.
We need to water the flowers.
He's studying hard so he can pass the entrance exam.
We're not on a date.
I've been waiting here for him since this morning.
I heard that there were alligators in the sewers.
I'm at your disposal.
Is there any more beer?
I got one for Christmas.
We invited him to our house.
Tom doesn't like pizza.
He sold us out.
Tom couldn't persuade Mary to stay.
As soon as the bell rang, we got up.
Where's all this coming from?
Give this book to Ramu.
She treated him very well.
Did you take him home?
That's my fault.
I will wait until she comes.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
He will play tennis tomorrow.
Since it was raining, we had to eat our picnic lunch indoors.
She shouldn't go by herself.
The baby is crawling.
We're always careful.
I'll be glad to help him.
I had a stroke.
She was my first girlfriend.
You understand German, right?
You should probably go, Tom.
That's interesting.
Tom couldn't find the words to express how he was feeling.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
What train you are going to take?
Explain that to me.
You're fortunate.
Why did you accept this assignment?
Tom isn't good-looking.
Where did you have the suit made?
Doing it that way will take a long time.
I'd be happy to help.
It won't take long.
Do you know who wrote this book?
I play golf every chance I get.
We need to make sacrifices.
I wish I were a prince.
I want Tom to come back.
He is a good loser.
Sometimes all we have is our dreams.
The plants were damaged by the frost.
There's no time.
Like I said, no problem.
Tom showed Mary his baby pictures.
Tom liked that.
You can adjust the seat height by moving the adjustment lever up.
What time did you arrive there?
I like lots of butter on my toast in the morning.
I was afraid of that.
Enjoy your meal!
Can I use a credit card for payment?
He filled the bottle with water.
He shouldn't have done that.
Did they say how?
He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't.
I didn't know you had a week off last month.
Tom sang better than Mary did.
"I would love to go to the dance with you." "Really? You would?"
How are you going to handle this?
Don't think about it too much.
What kind of stone is this?
I can't blame you.
Do you know how to drive a car?
Tom is going to make it on time.
I'd accept.
Tom only listens to heavy metal.
I listened to his story.
I don't even vote.
Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
Why did God create the universe?
Tom says he has no trouble falling asleep.
It's hard to admit to yourself that you are a failure.
All of them died.
She makes sure that her family eats a balanced diet.
You can't buy it anywhere but there.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages.
I saw the match on television.
We took a walk along the river.
A dog has four legs.
I'd help if I could.
I don't read newspapers much.
That's exactly what I want.
The court condemned the man to death by lethal injection.
Are you sure about this?
Come here, all of you.
Improved medical technology has been one of the spin-offs of the space program.
I want you to run to the store for me.
What kind of deodorant do you prefer, spray or roll-on?
I want this one myself.
He has no hat on.
She brought him to our place to meet my parents.
It's a no-brainer.
Let me see that list.
Give it to them.
Thank you for greeting me.
Mary didn't wear any jewelry.
I almost believe you.
The button on your coat is coming off.
You are early.
He is quick to voice his concerns.
Let's go downtown.
That's the ugliest baby that I've ever seen.
You're not a suspect.
Let me get you some ice.
I do not feel like doing it.
I hope Tom will be very happy.
Show me what you bought.
They said they would accept the committee's decision as final.
We can't afford that.
He's not going to visit you tomorrow.
In Japan, the new school year begins in April.
Did you listen to music last night?
That's the whole point.
Does Tom have a job?
What is the name of that bird?
Tom wondered what Mary would say if she knew he had spent the past week in Boston with Alice.
It's a cloudy day.
He came late, as is often the case with him.
In autumn, leaves change color and fall.
He came just as I was leaving.
Who believes in God?
He is the only one of my friends that is talented.
That would be a good idea.
What were you doing at that time?
He turned over the business to his son.
It has been fine for a week.
Do you want me to call the police?
My brother became an engineer.
She told him her age.
This book is smaller.
That man has a very good build.
I slept very well last night.
I think we should stop now.
I want more.
My friend helped me.
Tom's gotten fatter since the last time I saw him.
I do this for a living.
He is a doctor and a university professor.
Aren't you going to say something?
That sounds like a great plan.
I suppose that's true.
I'm not good at multitasking.
I don't want to force you to go.
I want to become rich.
She looked well when I last saw her.
He said it was out of the question.
You could come and live with me.
He was the first to help her.
I don't have time to read.
Feel free to call me if you need anything.
I really hope you're right.
Death is often compared to sleep.
He changed schools last year.
Who plays the keyboards in your band?
I was happy to see him.
Nothing is as important as peace.
I will wait outside.
I wish I could give up smoking.
I was eventually released.
There is no more cheese left.
You don't seem very satisfied.
She traveled around the world.
Would you like a cup of tea?
I'm afraid I've run short of coffee.
I just got married.
How do you know where to go?
It's not safe to swim in that river.
What's that stain?
Somebody saw you.
It does not matter to me whether you come or not.
What should I do in the meantime?
This bed is way too soft for me.
I know you're not comfortable.
What's so hard to believe?
We don't have anything to eat.
I've been way busier than expected.
Are you a law student?
The engine died.
I think you'll have very little difficulty in getting a driver's license.
She prepared a wonderful meal for us.
Tom seems to be very surprised.
It's on my desk.
They announced that they were going to have a party.
You've got the wrong number.
You are not at all wrong.
We now come to the point.
I prefer to remain seated.
Did you accomplish your goals?
I broke up with Tom.
I didn't scream.
The court found him guilty.
Tears rolled down his cheeks.
Is that all you think about?
I know what to study.
I wonder what language they speak in Brazil.
Why don't you give me a break?
Tom was afraid that Mary might change her mind.
Do you drink alcohol?
Is it yours?
I cannot eat anything today.
I was drunk.
I'm going to put it in my room.
I understand the sentence, but I'm not able to translate it.
What happened at the beach?
What do you think now?
I think Tom has gone.
She must be over eighty.
He's innocent.
That was a shock.
I lost my camera.
We admire you.
Please be sure to turn off the light before you leave.
All of us have some interest in history. In a sense, we are all historians.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for the rest of his life.
I walk in the forest every day.
I will complete what he started.
Did you say something?
I can't see my dad.
You've run out of things to drink.
I have a pen pal in Australia.
He never talked about it.
I just keep finding excuses.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
Someone has torn two pages out of this book.
I love it!
She as well as her friends is fond of music.
I do not feel guilty.
I think it's time for me to retire.
Do you guys want to read what I wrote?
See you tomorrow at school.
You're a nervous wreck.
If you're tired, rest.
I can't keep it.
I must get a new suit made.
Is he tall?
Tom is our guest.
I live next door.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
We'll have to do this quickly.
On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers.
Don't let me down like you did the other day.
I really want you to hug me.
No one will know.
You may eat anything as long as you don't eat too much.
This job is beyond my ability.
I just don't care enough.
Just keep moving.
How'd you do it?
I've got a sweet tooth.
I don't know which of you is older.
I will warn him.
I believe in God.
Nobody encouraged her.
What school did you go to?
He hasn't been heard from since he left the country.
Is it always a sin to tell a lie?
They've bet the farm on it.
How are you feeling tonight?
The research director had the department do a thorough job in testing the new product.
He no longer lives here.
She accused him of having lied to her.
You are not consistent.
I'm forgetful.
He came at me with a knife in his hand.
Don't shoot.
Would you say they match?
Is he back already?
Tom leaned back against the wall.
I hate this school.
Tom will go, too, won't he?
I support him.
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.
I'm getting a bad feeling.
Tom isn't going to let you do that.
I left my dictionary downstairs.
I like mathematics.
Tom isn't going to let you do that.
What dangers do we face?
I'll do the best I can.
It's starting to grow on us.
I'll be with you in a sec.
Don't worry. You can count on me.
There is a strong bond between the brothers.
Do you think your money is safe in a bank?
Is it broken?
A picture is worth a thousand words.
We were shocked at the news of his death.
Nobody's going to hire you.
How much did you pay?
Do you know something I don't know?
Look out the window.
I prefer to go alone.
I think you're bleeding.
The building was heavily damaged by fire.
I buy loads of stuff at that store.
I know that boy who is running.
That's quite common.
I'd love to be a fly on the wall at the meeting of the senior executives about the future of the company.
She is getting better day by day.
I have an eating disorder.
I remember when I first saw you.
Tom wasn't able to find a babysitter on such short notice.
You can't carry on like this.
I have a headache this morning.
I've never seen a whale that big.
Are you an idiot?
I asked for a seat in the non-smoking section.
I saw someone.
That is his house.
It's more polite to say thin than skinny.
You're very wise.
I want ice cream for dessert.
Please show me another one.
Someone has taken my shoes by mistake.
When they are in danger, they run away.
Tom doesn't want to go alone.
Tom told me to be more careful.
I am seeing my uncle tomorrow.
Are you motivated?
I won't have enough time for everything I want to do.
I'm going to start with this one.
How do we explain this?
Everybody thought so.
Sugar dissolves in water.
Maybe Tom will help us find Mary.
We had to react quickly.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
How can you be so sure?
When I get through with my work, I'll call you.
He and I have been good friends since we were children.
The test of the new engine takes place today.
You can look now.
Do you see anything?
They clung together for warmth.
Call me right back.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
It was a deplorable accident.
Everybody came to the class on time.
We need sleep.
You're not young anymore.
Are you real sure about that?
Though wounded, they continued to fight.
Will it make a difference?
Were you hurt?
I had a great teacher.
Tom is a bit older than Mary.
The old man is always accompanied by his grandson.
I'm disgusted.
Do you have a pet?
She's six years older than I am.
The train arrived on time.
We're moving out of this apartment next month.
I traded in my old car for a new one.
She doesn't speak my language.
I love life.
I'll leave no stone unturned to find out who did this.
I'm really embarrassed.
Who was that you were just talking to?
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
At Christmas he went out of his way to buy me a really nice model plane.
They're boring.
Half a million children still face malnutrition in Niger.
I've found a better way.
He ruined my life.
They're part-time employees.
I want to know who started it.
No one was there.
The dog followed me to my home.
I don't even like you.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I wonder if someone could help me do this.
Sorry to be late.
Please excuse me for calling you so early in the morning.
We already gave it to you.
I feel like crying.
I'm at Tom's house.
Don't you know his name?
How did you come up with that answer?
Where's the blouse I bought you?
Strange to say, he didn't know the news.
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
Let's meet up for a drink later.
I know that Tom loves you.

What options do I have left?
I'll use magic on him and turn him into a frog.

Tom could've killed you if he'd wanted to.
We took turns driving.
Your jeans are dirty.
Wow! It's been a long time.
I object to her going there alone.
It may snow in the evening.
What we should do next is the question.

This is the calm before the storm.
It was a hoax.
I went to Boston to visit Tom.
Your father won't buy it.
It's not what you think.

Are you writing a letter?
He gave the dog a bone.
My birthday falls on Sunday.

How about going swimming?
I'm sure you'll do very well.
You're the only one I trust.
Get it out of the house.
They were all there.
Let's do it now.
Let me deal with this.
It's possible that Tom was able to convince Mary to do his laundry for him.
I want to get my mind off work.
I made that decision on my own.

We need more data.

To try to bring it back would be foolish.
I think I understood.

I plan to study this afternoon after I get home.
You're so mean.
What can you give me?
It is time for you to go to bed.
The more books you read, the more you'll know.
Tom took off his shirt.
Now that he is old, it is your duty to go look after him.

I need you to show me what you have in your bag.
You've told me that already.
Are you going to Tom's party?
I think I'll lie down for a while.
Do you have lucid dreams?
I throw myself on the mercy of the court.
Do you have an interpreter?
I really need to talk to you privately.
There are no exceptions to this rule.
This is completely my fault.
We appreciate the advice.
I'll risk it.
An investigation is going on.
There was a bridge across each river.
We couldn't open the door because it was locked from the inside.
Do you think about Tom a lot?
We heard the door shut.
They are in the same class.
Your efforts came to nothing.
That wasn't very nice.
He wrote a book in China.
You can't help me.
Get on your feet.
Does he need to go right away?

The court's decision is final.
That helped.

That was painful to watch.
I think it's time for me to confront that problem.
I was thinking about getting married.
You're naive.
Do you have any water?
My mother set the table.
How long have you been a teacher?
Tom explained the rules to Mary.
Let's sit down somewhere.
We complained that the room was cold.
You don't need to do that anymore.
Horses run fast.
I heard that Tom doesn't speak French.
You're cruel.

That's stupid.

Choose between these two.
If you run into trouble, I'll help, and so will my father.

Is it satisfactory?
I think you're being a little too careful.
My children wear out their shoes quickly.
I already took the pies out of the oven.

Tell me where she lives.
You're back.

It's your decision.
I think you're drinking out of my glass.
Tom looks extremely happy.
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
Could we discuss this?
Do you know why he wasn't at school?
May I use your phone?
Most souvenir shops are filled with worthless knick-knacks.
We season with salt.
I met him while I was staying in Paris.

I lost my umbrella.
We admired the beauty of the scenery.

I'd like you to be my guest tonight.
Can I take a break?
How dare you talk to my son like that!
They all killed themselves.
People rose in revolt against the King.
I don't have much interest in cooking.
Did I mention that?
Tom found a hundred dollar bill on the street.
He went there instead of his father.
This one is on me.
We're not doing this for the money.
We need to be prepared.
What is the name of that river?
Our team lost.
What's that in your hands?
Here, have a drink.
My parents are opposed to my sister marrying a foreigner.
You're lazy.
You bet I'm angry.
It's easy for him to make friends.
The bar was so smoky that my eyes started to sting.
Tom wants to marry Mary.
He rushed into the room with his coat on.
All of us know him well.
His story is much more interesting than hers.
He began running.
Could you translate this sentence?
Tom hasn't told me anything.
I am much obliged to you for your help.
A beautiful girl sat next to me.
Does everybody understand?
This is food.
Can this be just between you and me?
Corn is an important crop in the United States.
He is above doing such a thing.
It was very nice seeing you again.
I can't do without your advice.
His death was a great loss to our firm.
He acts quickly.
Tom looks older than he really is.
Yeah, you could be right.
I thought you wouldn't like it.
Don't be so impatient.
Did Tom say what he wanted?
Be proud of yourself.
The sun is a star.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What made her do that?
He doesn't have a computer.
I chickened out.
I'm really not up on recent TV shows.
Don't sass me.
I'm running out of closet space.
Did you see that?
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
Years of running in marathons have taken a toll on my knees.
I'll work.
Tom trusts you.
My father is very strict with me.
What do you want to drink with your meal?
I was so humiliated.
Winter is right around the corner.
I need to get something.
He didn't see anything.
How thoughtful of you to have chilled some wine for us.
You hurt my feelings.
Tom raised his right hand.
The decision has not yet been made.
Why is this only in French?
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
The girl had a large red hat on.
Do you speak Latin?
It takes time.
They are my friends.
I unfolded the map on the desk.
She won't call this evening.
Tom doesn't know much about guns.
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow.

The park is located in the center of the city.
A few glasses of wine can loosen the tongue.
They danced all night long.

Maybe I went a little too far.
Did you think of that?
My dog is blind, but he loves to go out for a walk.
It's very good.
You're very sharp.
It's next to impossible to finish it in a day.
I sliced the apple.
If we don't have a solution, the least we can do is acknowledge that there's a problem.
Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened?
Since there are usually multiple websites on any given topic, I usually just click the back button when I arrive on any webpage that has pop-up advertising. I just go to the next page found by Google and hope for something less irritating.
Don't touch me.
I had the gardener plant some trees.
My sister has long legs.
She looks confused.

This is the village where I spent my childhood.
Why are you sitting there?
Tell us the truth now.
Has he failed again?
I'm not going to stop working.
If I had had more money, I would have bought the pen.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
We need it now more than ever.
It doesn't count.
How fast can you do it?
It's not that hard.
He has very bad luck.
Tom didn't take many pictures on his trip.
"Are the drinks free?" "Only for ladies."
Let's improvise.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I hated you at first.
Where's everybody?
Don't you like swimming?
This is the right answer.
I refrain from drinking.
If that happens, call me.
What's your favorite holiday?
This is a dirty movie.
Do you want to use mine?
He found his master.
Can you ride a bicycle?
The students sat in a circle.

I think I can do better.
What is your problem?
I only have three dollars on me.

I feel awful about that.
Japan is a rich country.

I don't particularly want to do that.
It's been snowing all night.
Thank you for closing the door.
The job looked quite simple, but it took me a week.
You have to choose your own path.
Look at me when I talk to you!
That wasn't too bad.
This doesn't make sense.
Keep the money in a safe place.
It doesn't surprise me that you know.
What did you do yesterday?
If he keeps drinking like that, he'll have to take a taxi home.

I need more details.
His childlike laugh is charming.
I got my hair cut today.
I figured I'd find you here.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
The terrible scene made him tremble in fear.
I am convinced that he is innocent.
Stop worrying about that.
I sometimes hear rumors about her.
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.
I had to work overtime yesterday.
He was very naughty when he was a little boy.
I'm thirty.
That's not a bad thing.
My father quit drinking.
It feels horrible to be pitied.
I really like this restaurant.
What a hypocrite!
You don't seem too surprised.
It is useless to go on strike now.
Other scientists are debating his theory about the disappearance of dinosaurs.
I'm a vegetarian.
I cannot fix the computer.
You probably just want to be alone.
I want you to take this medicine.
He made me a suit.
How many nights will you stay?
Old people need something to live for.
It's a fairly complicated problem.
I can't let you go in there alone.
We complained that the room was cold.
Our team is two points ahead.
That's all I can ask.
Why is it that you hate Tom so much?
What time does the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
I figured I had enough money.
He addressed the audience in a soft voice.
He dropped the cup and broke it.
There's still room for improvement.
The enemy attack ended at dawn.
I thought the show was over.
You are so childish sometimes.
The boy made his parents happy.
Can you lend me 500 yen?
My father bought me a digital watch for birthday present.
The coat doesn't have any pockets.
Your father is tall.
Can you hold the elevator, please?
I'm not deaf.
He told me that I should be more careful.
We bought a new washing machine.
I liked your story.
Tom told me I was wrong.
Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
I know a lot about environmental problems.
That's old news.
Can I use your pen?
I plead guilty.
I hate the tie you're wearing.
How old were you when your father was killed?
Please copy this page.
He must be crazy to go out in this stormy weather.
How about going to see a movie with me?
You were right, you know.
When Tom stopped for a stop sign, his engine stalled.
Did you take the money?
I'm very worried about your health.
It's stopped snowing.
He visited a friend.
I gathered from this letter that he was angry.
I am not a witch.
Are they Canadian?
Please mail this form to your insurance company.
"Is he seriously ill?" "I hope not."
Would you like one?
Wow! What a big box!
She has brains.
We all laughed.
Isn't it true?
I don't steal.
There wasn't enough.
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover.
I thought you wanted to wait.
We haven't heard anything from them yet.
I'm surprised this machine still works.
I lost my travelers checks.
You should give up smoking and drinking.
She picked up the phone.
Are you referring to me?
What's the matter with you?
You were clearly mistaken.
Am I in love?
I gave you a chance, but you didn't take it.
They just want an excuse to fire you.
It's too late now.
I want you to stay where you are.
We have to find a way to get that done.
Did you know this was coming down?
It's easy to see why.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I finally got across the river.
Tom gave his dog a hug.
I like hot tea better than cold.
Will you take a personal check?
She is an expert in mathematics.
I want to lose a few pounds.
Let's go get snockered like we did last weekend.
Please fill out this form.
Where do you come from?
Should we run for it?
Did you do yesterday's homework?
What are you going to do next?
Will anything really change?
We can't keep this a secret forever.
It's not the job.
I'll never forget you.
That was really bad.
My sister likes melons and so do I.
He smiled and left.
Come in for a minute.
Tom lives in the same apartment building as Mary does.
She devoted herself to him.
I don't have time to do the laundry.
Does Tom like to swim?
I am going to have a great day today.
Take your hat off when you enter a house of worship.
I want life to be the way it was before.
Would it help me?
Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school tomorrow morning.
There must be some kind of problem.
Stay here and wait for him.
Don't get a stomachache by eating too much.
They accused me of being a liar.
I have no idea how it works.
Tom isn't very imaginative.
I'm not taking sides.
Have you heard this story already?
He's intelligent.
Isn't this place great?
That was pretty intense.
Tom said that Mary was beautiful.
They don't know us.
I just remembered.
I guess you know I've missed you.
He paid a visit to his friend.
She can swim.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
These are difficult questions.
The storm kept us from searching for the missing child.
Nobody backed up what I said.
Is it any warmer inside?
I'd like to do that, but I can't.
Don't rock the boat.
You're the one who planted that tree.
Who vanished?
There was no water in the well.
We must see the matter in its proper perspective.
They were not listening to music.
What did you think of the party?
I want you to analyze this.
Tom needs you here.
Quit gambling.
What narrow stairs!
It was so cold that we made a fire.
In a word, she is guilty.
Do you want to come over tonight?
I miss you so much.
Could we take you somewhere else?
I have absolutely nothing to do.
Your hair is beautiful.
It's cold out here.
Isn't there something you want to say to Tom?
Judging from his accent, he is from Kansai.
How could you know?
Come here right now.
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
My grandfather died when I was boy.
Darwin changed the world.
Are you sure of your answer?
Don't tell him the answer.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
I just have to make a call.
This will be a game changer.
I was planning on going to the beach today, but then it started to rain.
We need to figure out what works and what doesn't work.
My day ends at 5 o'clock.
He is something of an artist.
It's the rule, not the exception.
This is huge.
It's revolting.
Why is it so hard for people to understand that I just want to be left alone?
I want to stay with you.
The check, please.
I don't think I can wait any longer.
What's in this box?
You're a wonderful guy.
My grandfather was wounded in the war.
Don't touch the glass.
Suicide is an act of desperation.
The game's almost over.
You've been very kind to me.
Please forgive me for not answering your letter.
How do you know what I heard?
It is impossible for me to do the work in a week.
He left for New York a week ago.
I don't think I realized how much I loved you.
I suppose it couldn't be helped.
Let's walk to the bookstore.
You can't just make everyone do what you want them to.
We have to figure out a way to get out of here alive.
Slavery is a crime against humanity.
Someone broke into my house and ran away with all of my money.
His unique perspective helped shed light on the situation.
I don't want to hear about all your ex-boyfriends.
Don't let the dog sleep in our bed.
I saw them.
He made up his mind to go there.
I like tea.
How much time do we have?
Write with your left hand.
I'm so proud of my team.
I've got a toothache.
The machine's yours now.
You're trustworthy.
Your shoes are dirty.
You weren't married for long, were you?
She told him that her father had died.
Are you a Buddhist?
They accused him of telling a lie.
I kept my mouth shut.
It was because he was sick that he decided to return home.
Do you speak English?
I need ice.
That matter will take care of itself.
We depend on each other.
That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
She came close to drowning.
The first time, she wasn't very firm with him.
Give it to me.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
You're the teacher.
You should be respectful to your parents.
They all looked happy.
He speaks broken French.
Like it or not, you must do it.
I suggest you listen carefully.
Tom never said a word to me.
What should I do to save time?
You are drunk!
You did this.
It was just a matter of time.
Stop arguing.
The ice is melting.
You should have known better than to go out in the rain without an umbrella.
I felt my heart beating violently.
Can you pitch?
Who's coming for dinner?
We were too late.
The hero died at the end of the book.
She took a taxi to the museum.
Isn't this wonderful?
You must not jump to conclusions.
I'm sure you never told me not to do this.
I want to know more about your school life.
What exactly happened?
I put the money into the safe.
Don't you ever call Tom?
My vision's getting worse.
I need to talk to Tom right now.
Those who know him like him.
I put it on your desk.
What color are your wife's eyes?
I can't handle them.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
I don't know what'll happen.
We've all read that one.
Do you want to come out and play?
I want to let go of your hands now.
I feel so embarrassed.
I think I'll do that.
My father isn't home.
You are right in a way.
I really, really need it.
Don't they drive you mad?
Remove the chicken's giblets before cooking.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
He expected that their talk was going to be long.
She may have told me a lie.
You must help your mother.
Do you plan to buy that car?
As soon as she opened the door, a cat ran out.
I really have nothing else to say.
The higher he rose in social rank, the more modest he became.
They made me wait for a long time.
She speaks Chinese.
They have plenty of water.
Sign this.
He complains of not having enough time to read.
Tom was sitting at a nearby table.
I can't buy you that dress.
Since we insulated the house we've saved a lot on heating oil.
You're not impressing me.
Do you believe me now?
Why are you bleeding?
Are you the new teacher?
Don't jump!
I thought I'd always be alone.
It could happen to anybody.
She insisted that I should see the doctor.
He has a heart of gold.
Maybe he likes you, too.
I'd rather not eat the meat from an animal that was cloned.
I can't eat that much food by myself.
We're asking you not to do that.
I have a dog.
Tom peeked inside.
That's not an option.
He likes vegetables, especially cabbage.
And now you wish perhaps to learn on less familiar traps?
The lights are on.
I've been waiting for him for an hour.
You haven't told me your name yet.
He thinks I'm jealous.
Have you seen all these movies?
I'm not sure of the exact date.
I didn't have to open the letter. I knew exactly what it said.
This school supplies students with textbooks.
We're stuck.
Answer my question.
I lived in New York last year.
I wish nothing but the best for you.
She was quite eager in her studies.
Do you trust her?
How did you come by this painting?
Their way of thinking is behind the times.
You're taller than me.
Where did you spend your holidays?
Now that my brother is a university student, he has to do a lot of reading.
Cicadas aren't harmful to humans.
We'll starve.
She asked after her friend.
Can I have a word with Tom in private?
The students all laughed.
She is helping him.
Are you on dope?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Did I drop that?
It's your responsibility.
Tom doesn't trust us.
You're a liar.
This is all he has to do.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
Is Tom around?
Don't be so dramatic.
I think there's a problem.
Can I see the special exhibit with this ticket?
I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot.
I don't need crutches anymore.
I don't think I could ever do that.
Where can I buy a ticket?
Just get out of here.
Where's your daughter?
It was bad enough that he usually came to work late, but coming in drunk was the last straw, and I'm going to have to let him go.
His nose is his best feature.
You can't handle it.
Try to control yourselves.
I never wore that hat again.
He is not at all foolish.
She showed me around the campus.
I want to discuss a very important matter with you.
I'll go even if it rains heavily.
He acts very shy in her presence.
One problem translators face is that sometimes the source document is poorly written.
Bears hibernate during the winter.
I thought perhaps you'd give up.
Luckily nobody drowned.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
I can't do that, sir.
We have nothing against it.
I'm glad you were able to meet Tom.
He is capable of doing such a thing.
The situation gets worse and worse.
I'm too tired to think.
He selected a pair of socks to match his suit.
That's a wise decision.
How long has Tom been like this?
I'm immune.
You always said you wanted to become a scientist. Why didn't you?
There's so much I want to say to you.
He arrived as soon as he could.
No one has yet found the fountain of youth.
That's not something to joke about.
Are you trying to scare me?
The world doesn't revolve around you.
I gave him a call.
The Shinano is longer than any other river in Japan.
I want to ask you one last favor.
Try it again.
Does anyone know you're here?
I hate the tie you're wearing.
I told her what to do.
Give me some time to think.
Did you hear that?
That house is big.
This afternoon we will have an interview.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you'd just done what I told you.
I love trying to do new things.
I listen to the radio every night.
I was too surprised to speak.
I like dogs, but my sister likes cats.
The volcano has erupted twice this year.
I interpreted what he said in French into Japanese.
May I show you something?
I am in the habit of taking a walk every day.
I only wish that were possible.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
Tom is Mary's son.
Do you know anything about your family?
Do you spend more time at home or at work?
Put on your pajamas and go to bed.
May I ask a question?
What are some foods you usually eat with your fingers?
Tom said he was very happy.
You're the teacher.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same thing.
Who are you supposed to be?
If she had married you, she would be happy now.
We're going dancing.
Why are you speaking in French?
How do I know you're not bluffing?
Tom cut down the tree with his chainsaw.
There's no need to apologize.
I thought I had until 2:30.
Please don't forget to put a stamp on the letter before mailing it.
The mail has arrived.
Don't move unless I tell you.
He had the good fortune to find a good wife.
I take it back.
She caught her breath.
I expected you home an hour ago.
Have you ever thought of becoming a nurse?
She wants to meet him again.
She thought of a good way to make money on the Internet.
I guess you're right.
This river is the widest in Europe.
I'll be back within two hours.
This isn't supposed to be happening.
She asked me to continue writing to your father.
I'm delighted to see you.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to.
The weather is terrible today.
Contact me for more information.
I bet you've never climbed a tree.
He has two daughters, one is a pianist and the other is a violist.
Aren't you sick of eating fast food?
I'd like to know what it is.
I've never made this kind of mistake before.
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
Food shouldn't look like this.
Maybe we really are alone.
I prefer plain materials.
Tom is tidying his room.
I'll take him with me to the hospital.
Tom isn't good at math.
I beg you.
A nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
I know Tom well.
I have something to say to all of you.
The train was almost an hour behind schedule today.
She's a bit naive.
I just had a talk with your teacher.
Did I give you enough time?
His father left him the house in his will.
Let's face it, it's impossible. We're never gonna make it.
I have a bad toothache.
They married when they were young.
I hit him in the belly.
I'll shoot.
What we want is freedom.
He is said to have died.
Tom never got better.
They don't make them like they used to.
The bus stop is close by.
She is dead.
A thief broke into the house to steal the money.
I heard you just got married.
Children often try to imitate their elders.
Let's see if Tom can help.
It seems like an interesting job. What do you exactly do?
Do you have any other questions about the matter?
Why pay when you can get it for free?
I can protect you.
The hiker has reached the top of the mountain.
He was absent at roll call.
I want to be alone for a while.
We've been warned.
Tom is going to go swimming this afternoon.
How long does it take from here to your house on foot?
I didn't notice it.
They're students.
Did you tell anybody?
Tom asked us to turn the music down.
God sent a sign.
Don't call the police.
I want the work done quickly.
I'm not hungry anymore.
Drink more water.
Can I have the paper when you're finished with it?
Do you think Tom killed himself?
Tom loved Mary and Mary loved him.
I love trying new things.
I don't know if that means anything.
Let's take a short break.
Germany borders on France.
I knew you'd come back to me.
If you want to come, you can.
The sky turned dark.
I think you know that's not true.
We should do everything ourselves.
My sister has made remarkable progress in English.
The streets aren't safe at night.
His joke made us all laugh.
It was flat.
No minors allowed.
My father used to eat at this restaurant.
I'll do it in the morning.
This table is made out of wood.
My father works here.
I am sure that he will become a great singer.
How much thinner do you want to be?
I need to warn my mom.
What're you writing?
I can carry those suitcases for you.
This is a great theory.
How can we learn the truth?
Our parents took care of us and now it's our turn to take care of them.
They were cousins.
Smoking is not permitted here.
You don't need to take your shoes off.
Who's that cute redhead?
I brought these flowers for you.
You have been warned.
You can also ride on an old, restored, steam train.
When do you mean to start?
She has nothing in common with him.
This is your house now.
I'll write you as soon as I arrive there.
There was not enough fuel.
His company didn't survive the crisis.
He just naturally avoids everything that is intense, difficult or strenuous.
My camera can shoot high-definition video.
I ate your piece of cake.
He's three years older than her.
I like to listen to classical music.
You'll be OK.
They all understood your speech.
You are so stupid.
He nearly got away with it.
I have rights.
I sat behind a very tall person at the theater.
Don't let them go to waste.
Do you need a ride home later?
That's a photo of my sister.
I don't really like you.
I found it difficult to use the machine.
He sat next to her.
Can you account for all the money you spent?
You can use my dictionary.
I was there a year ago.
He is taller than any other boy in his class.
What is the name of that bird?
Move up to the front, please.
You are early.
Tom doesn't need to worry about Mary.
Are you courageous?
I don't want to know about this.
The people here are accustomed to the cold.
The pen I lost yesterday was a new one.
It was a sunny day.
I've got something else on my mind.
I want a puppy.
That's never happened to me before.
We had so much fun together.
You must study your whole life.
The answer was yes.
I continued reading.
Someone must have left the water running.
I couldn't remember the title of that song.
Respect your elders.
I felt depressed.
The company's insolvency forced it to file for bankruptcy.
Do you have more than one copy of this key?
He knows how to milk a cow.
Tom didn't give us any details.
Don't play baseball in the park.
I'm glad you're coming.
She had white shoes on.
I have no clue what you're talking about.
They acted on the information.
We're in charge.
He won the prize last week.
He fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident.
Everybody already knew that.
I have had my hair cut shoulder length.
I advised him to give up smoking.
I didn't want to bug you.
Contact my son.
It took more than a month to get over my cold, but I'm OK now.
It's going to be tricky.
It is sunny today.
Take a chance.
Your answer is far from perfect.
Can you ride a bicycle?
He is used to speaking in public.
It's redundant.
He did what he had to do.
I'm eating now.
He felt himself lifted up.
Tom pushed back his chair and got up.
Why were you so slow?
My uncle lives in Madrid, the capital of Spain.
Is there anything you need?
It took me three days to clean the room.
Stop arguing.
I heard you don't eat meat.
I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
The audience could hardly wait for the concert to begin.
He played a minor part in the play.
I don't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
I think Tom will be well prepared.
I think we're pretty lucky.
He mentioned it.
I felt guilty.
Where did they learn this?
The equations are very complicated.
That rock band gives me a headache.
I'm a little bit tired.
Can you give me another pillow?
He seldom writes to his father.
I'm glad I left Boston.
What I told you about him also holds true for his brother.
May I have everyone's attention, please?
She advised him to stop drinking.
Could you buy everything you needed?
Is Tom a common name in your country?
For what purpose did he come here?
I didn't know you had a cat.
Let me get this straight.
I was sick.
Do your homework by yourself.
I'm afraid we'll lose the game.
Hurry up. The train leaves in ten minutes. We don't want to miss it.
It was very funny.
It's redundant.
She devoted herself to him.
Please remember to turn off the light before going to bed.
It's more fun than studying.
How long have you been learning French?
This book's new.
You shouldn't break promises.
I'll follow you anywhere.
The conference went according to plan.
He doesn't want you to know.
No one ate anything.
Mt. Fuji is higher than any other mountain in Japan.
I just wanted you to know that.
I won't do it again.
Give us a minute, OK?
Let's not waste this chance.
I can't forgive him for behaving like that.
Let's postpone until next week.
Tom intends to live in Boston for more than a year.
I'm now busy writing a book.
You're exhausted.
I'll read it.
Where do you think we came from?
If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet, try talking with one of them in real life.
I won't attend the party.
Do you have any aspirin on you?
I don't feel so special.
I'll sleep on the floor.
Don't make such a racket!
"I feel like playing cards." "So do I."
Those are our books.
May I ask you to close the window?
His success was in part due to luck.
You are twice as strong as I am.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
It's your decision.
I don't really understand the problem.
Many consumer reviews on Amazon are fake.
I feel vulnerable.
You're sloshed.
Try not to be so tense.
There's something I need to tell you before you leave.
I thought Tom would say that.
He was the only man.
"Are scientists close to cloning a human being?" "Not by a long shot."
He was in good health last summer.
Children should be taught not to tell lies.
God, you're beautiful.
He gives an apple to the teacher every day.
That's how I found out about it.
I have to leave early to catch the train.
What do I get in return?
Tell me why you think that.
They rescued the boy from drowning.
Tom is slow.
Who are you working for now?
The papers didn't print this story.
They're not my rules.
We have a problem.
That's what I did today.
You aren't smiling.
I'm sorry to upset your plans.
I'm ready to make amends.
I have a question to ask you.
I have no will power when it comes to exercising.
They love their kids.
I think maybe that was my fault.
Why didn't you run?
He has a short attention span.
It seems interesting.
I'm very disappointed in you.
He is afraid of swimming.
You're big.
I don't remember you at all.
You are holding my hand in that picture.
He has a tight schedule.
You ate my sandwich.
I'm being held hostage.
Tom had to do everything himself.
I can't do this by myself.
I can do this all night.
I don't think they heard us.
I want to find out what Tom did yesterday.
That would be a waste of her talent.
Tom doesn't think he could do that.
I can't help you with this.
Please accept my sincerest condolences.
I lost the watch.
I think it's fine.
I didn't want any of that.
Tom speaks French, and so does Mary.
We happened to meet at the station.
I've got an appointment tomorrow with Tom.
Where ever did you buy it?
You're a woman now.
Both Tom and Mary were absent today.
I'm glad you're here.
Are you always that busy?
Does it matter?
Are you through with the paper?
I'm going to have to call you right back.
The youth was arrested for being involved in a riot.
I'm going to need some more money.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I hope you have insurance.
Would you care for more coffee?
I don't want your job.
It was him that broke the window yesterday.
What are you crying for?
I want you to read this book.
Hurry, and you will catch the train.
Are cats smarter than dogs?
Have you looked at these brochures?
I think you're going to find this interesting.
The offer is too good to turn down.
I'm ugly.
I'd like a cup of tea.
I thought I heard music.
I'm going to fix some dinner.
Do it when you have time.
Where is the nearest supermarket?
Could you send someone up to make the bed?
Is there anything that I can do for you?
She advised him not to drive too fast, but he wouldn't listen to her.
I must find some new friends.
I am looking for a job near my house.
Here's what you wanted.
Batteries are not included.
He went down the hill.
You're the teacher.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Boston for more than a year.
This book is worth reading.
Have you told your parents?
Where does this piece go?
You're really annoying.
I was hurt by many people.
How many books can I take out at one time?
Tom is sitting on the sofa, reading a magazine.
The next morning, the snowman had completely melted.
You were hurt, weren't you?
I've seen one many times.
Get rid of her.
The phone rang for a long time.
Whose guitar is this?
Tom is the star of the show.
I'm going to reconsider it.
I'm really bad with names, but I never forget a face.
She advised him not to buy a used car, but he didn't follow her advice.
English is taught in a lot of countries.
Are you all finished here?
I lost no time in doing it.
Tom has a lot of enemies.
You don't have to eat with Tom, but I wish you would.
I smoked when I was young.
I think you're being a little too careful.
I thought you were broke.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
What was it that we were told to do?
Pay attention to what you're doing.
My favorite subjects in high school were geometry and history.
I only eat vegetables that I grow myself.
I want to go with you tonight.
I can't take chances.
She did her best to help him.
Japanese people are considered to be polite.
Tom waved his arms.
I'll give you anything you want within reason.
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
I thought you'd be older.
They want you dead.
I have to write a letter.
Why didn't you tell me you couldn't swim?
She lives with him.
Man is the only animal that can speak.
You said you didn't care.
We were all shocked.
Don't talk to me!
I'm often only half awake.
There may be some truth to this.
The jury is deliberating.
I'd like you to sing a song for me.
Please have a drink.
Don't you think I know my own father?
It's still not right.
The job is almost done.
We have two children.
Have you eaten yet?
Please feel free to ask questions.
I am trying to learn English.
I can't bring myself to do such a thing.
I let them go.
Do you know what I mean?
We flew nonstop from Osaka to Los Angeles.
Are you ready to do that?
Don't look at us.
Women are better at this than men.
Do you understand or not?
Don't forget to call me up tomorrow.
I borrowed it.
I'm not the only one with a child.
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
We called off the wedding.
Your coat is very beautiful.
He got off the train.
Tom told me he knew how to speak French.
Tom was a blackmailer.
He made me sing.
They called for an end to the fighting.
I'm surviving.
I got you a present.
Tom died at the age of ninety-nine.
They did what they were told.
The loss amounted to $2,000,000.
I often played baseball when I was young.
You're not supposed to be in here.
How much is an apple?
If you are hungry, why don't you eat?
Are you dating anyone?
I let him sleep at my house for the night.
Everyone needs friends.
I'm strict.
You shouldn't depend on others too much.
I didn't think you needed one.
Would you mind not doing that?
I told you not to play your cello late at night, but you did and now the neighbors have complained.
Do you think you could stop doing that?
Can't you see it's bigger than the both of us?
You can't just not go to work.
I keep my hammer in the toolbox.
I'm living with my parents.
He beat the odds and was successful.
I'll show my album to you.
Let's talk about what happened.
She is very angry with me.
What would you like to drink?
Who do you know here?
Give me a glass of water, please.
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
Put the eggs into the boiling water.
How does it feel to be a mother?
I'll visit you at your office tomorrow.
I took the medicine.
I don't know how to make stew.
Are you in a bad mood?
The two men were business partners.
Mary is very beautiful.
Let me pay for the dinner.
He examined the spare parts one after another.
What does that even mean?
He probably forgot about it.
How long does it take to get to Vienna on foot?
He is still grappling with religious beliefs.
It was a good choice.
We can't save everyone.
I want a book to read on the train.
His failing the test is no laughing matter.
You're always complaining.
He's making progress.
Give me the book.
It doesn't matter to me whether she comes here or not.
Tom can't hurt us anymore.
Tom broke up with me.
I'd never let that happen.
This novel consists of three parts.
A baby is sleeping in the cradle.
I want it to be a success.
Is there something in particular that you want to study?
Nothing's working.
I've been looking all over for you.
You have my word.
I was wrong about that.
I can't afford to pay so much.
Ask her what her name is.
I've never met her.
I vaguely remember meeting him.
That's not where I'm going.
I want to show you something very special.
Why did they do that?
People over the age of 18 can drive cars.
Open the doors.
This is a happy occasion.
Do you have an interpreter?
You are the last person I would have expected to see here.
Let's go to the beach.
We were disappointed with the results of the experiment.
I can't do it today.
I'm not a baby, you know!
Why were you there?
She bought chicken.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
It's important to know one's limits.
"Will he recover soon?" "I'm afraid not."
It is fine today.
Please use a pencil to write down your name.
All the goods for sale are set out on the tables.
I know what you're probably thinking.
I like to travel alone.
It has been a long time since I saw him.
That's just what we need.
Do you have a blog?
I'm a minister.
I must get my watch repaired.
He found it.
I won't tell Tom.
They'll be here at three.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
Don't read in this room.
I want to go wherever you're going.
The road is in a deplorable state.
I like what you've done with this place.
Are you recording this?
She couldn't have said that.
May I accompany you on your walk?
The only thing that matters is that you weren't injured.
Are you kidding?
I'm so glad I did this.
Tom needed somebody he could trust.
A lot of people feel the same way you do.
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
I've never felt so good in my life.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
He is playing there.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Try to remain calm.
Tom said that you wanted to go with us.
Inoue doesn't like computers.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
Tom said Mary was tempted to eat the last piece of cake, but left it for him.
I had back surgery a couple of months ago.
The team played hard because the championship of the state was at stake.
Tom looked at it suspiciously.
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.
What's wrong with your eyes?
I need time to think about all of this.
You think I'm stupid, don't you?
May I switch off the light?
That was our first encounter.
The mafia boss was killed in a hail of machine gun fire.
She had already gone to bed when I called her at 11 p.m.
I don't want to suffer.
They were very hungry.
I can't stand it here any longer. I need a change of scenery.
I really want you to quit.
To drive a car, you need a license.
Confessions obtained by torture are generally worthless.
I have to go to the store to buy some shampoo and toothpaste.
I don't want to torment you any longer.
I love the way you write.
Do you want to give it another try?
What she said made him angry.
His wife opened the door for him.
Aren't you afraid of anything?
"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
Tom is the one that doesn't like me.
Can you hear us?
I do not have the courage to ask my boss to lend me his car.
He's a scriptwriter.
Can you tell me who they are?
I bought a pen like yours yesterday.
Large catches of squid are a sign of a coming earthquake.
We have decided to adopt your idea.
I'm not telling you anything.
I love this company.
Tom retired when he was 65.
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
She was supposed to attend the party with him.
I'm going to put a curse on you.
Tom played a sad song on the piano.
I'm so happy that you're here.
Because of rain, we couldn't go to the beach.
You have only to ask for it.
Are you doing anything special for New Year's Eve?
I invited him over to my place.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
I can't believe you actually said that.
He has ten cows.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
Whether he will come at all is doubtful.
I'm famous.
I've already paid you.
I want to know the whole story.
You're very clever.
Hang that picture on the wall.
One language is not enough.
I need a little time.
She's most happy when she's at home.
Would you like something easier?
I felt bad about what I did.
There was a discussion on the measures.
Every time I go to see him, he is in bed.
Don't let them get you down.
The sun doesn't shine at night.
Do you read Tom's blog?
It's the least I could do.
I have read your book. It's very interesting.
I do not doubt it in the least.
Are you mentally ill?
Things have been pretty tough lately.
We're very excited.
You need to be more patient.
You're up to something.
Tell me where you went.
Do you want to ask me some questions?
They want you dead.
We thank you for your cooperation.
I was miserable without you.
He adjusted the telescope to his sight.
You have only to watch what I do.
Better a broken promise than none at all.
I wonder whether a man could live with only two hours' sleep a night.
People should have realistic expectations.
I've got to speak to you.
That noise is almost driving me mad.
I made a decision.
I love the way you kiss.
The challenges are enormous.
Don't mention this to anyone.
You shouldn't cancel the meeting.
He's a jesuit.
This is a big help.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
How much did it cost?
You can pour the wine into the glass.
He was shot 3 times in the arm.
Take a rest.
You disgust me.
If you bite me, I'll bite back.
You guessed right.
I appreciate all your help.
She's being nice to me.
Have you met anyone yet?
He'll never beat me.
I've been misunderstood.
I just don't like it.
I almost never watch TV.
I appreciate your work.
He wears expensive clothes and owns a lot of jewelry.
That was just icing on the cake.
It's not easy for me to travel alone in Japan.
I waited until the last minute.
We finally have you where we want you.
I baked it for you.
You have a message.
I may swim in the river.
I will translate.
Birds fly in the sky.
This doesn't make sense to me either.
I read a magazine to kill time.
Someone scratched my car.
You'll have a rough time.
I'm motivated.
I hate these words.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
I think that's where Tom works.
None of us want to go, but either you or your wife has to go.
It was surprising that she said that.
He was framed on a murder charge.
Why did Tom lie?
I am sorry that I have troubled you so much.
They danced all night long.
Are they cops?
Tom gave Mary something.
That river is dangerous to swim in.
Who wrote the letter?
I can't go, nor do I want to.
I'm alive.
I'd never met Tom before this morning.
I bought this book at Maruzen Bookstore.
I felt it was necessary, so I did it.
How do you even know that?
The thief got away with the money.
Please make five copies of this document.
The kindergarten children were walking hand in hand in the park.
When did you start studying Latin?
Who's watching?
I went to my bedroom and cried.
I was fired without cause.
I suggest you leave.
Are you still happy?
Who'll take care of the dog while we are gone?
Wash your face and hands.
Tom looks extremely happy.
That's not important for you to know.
You said you figured out why.
Our troops engaged with the enemy.
We're not gonna make it.
A loud noise jolted me awake from a deep sleep.
Don't shut your eyes.
I'm sorry if I scared you.
My wife is the boss at home.
I had never seen a panda till that time.
It was shorter than he expected.
Think carefully before answering.
They adore Tom.
Do you want something to eat?
This noise is annoying.
Who's your favorite super hero?
I buried it.
I am terribly busy because the report deadline is near.
Don't they drive you mad?
Don't read that kind of book.
We have finished lunch.
Do you want me to make coffee?
I thought you were working.
I went on reading.
I could not help but state my opinion.
We discussed what to do.
He turned his attention to the picture.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Don't you see what that means?
I got a call from the school today.
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
They have their own troubles.
We're twins.
When Tom died, I wanted to die.
They kissed each other.
She went in to get it.
What you've done is absolutely inexcusable.
She sat next to him wishing she were somewhere else.
Did I embarrass you?
I can't believe I just said that.
Give me a cup of coffee.
I don't know your name.
There is no limit to the universe.
She advised him not to go.
What's wrong with being nude in your own house?
Look, I'm being serious.
I'm completely wrecked.
Dinosaurs once ruled the earth.
We did that yesterday.
I found my bicycle gone.
How did you find out where Tom lives?
I have a lot of bills I have to pay.
Eat whatever food you like.
Did you miss me?
This is all very confusing.
I suggest that you not wait any longer.
We're all unique.
The towel wasn't useful at all.
Will he come this evening?
Tom told Mary he had to leave early.
Quit complaining.
Tom spoke into the microphone.
I've never had this problem before.
Don't you tell me my job.
He's so thin that he looks like a skeleton.
I saw something very bright fly across the night sky.
Maybe I exaggerated.
I hope it was worth it.
Hold on a minute.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
I let my sister use my new computer.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
It is never too late to learn.
Japanese gardens usually have ponds.
His house is within a stone's throw of his school.
Change your clothes.
When did you visit your friends?
A trip to America was equivalent to a two-year salary for her.
You better get some sleep.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
They used truth serum.
I feel kind of tired.
I couldn't find it.
Could you please reschedule the meeting at a time that is convenient for you?
You are a good person.
That sounds interesting.
May I have the check, please?
I'll be in touch.
I tied my dog to a tree in the garden.
You were jealous, weren't you?
The arrow missed its target.
Tom said that you wanted to go with us.
I must learn this poem by heart.
There is a small pond in our garden.
She seems reserved, but she's actually a strong-willed person.
Please put on your shoes.
How old are your kids?
Search everyone who comes into this room.
Last night's game was exciting.
I thought you might be upset.
I don't know whether you like her or not.
I'm glad you're early.
I never imagined I'd feel this way about you.
He likes baseball very much.
I just can't understand you sometimes.
Which do you like better, spring or autumn?
How do you remember that?
As far as I know, Tom is still married.
Her house is on the other side of the bridge.
Tom complained about the room being too small.
It is cheap, but on the other hand it is not good.
I want to sell this.
We haven't laid off any employees yet.
I was stung by a bee.
Doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
Don't sing.
I'd like to improve my French pronunciation.
I don't understand why you don't want to go to Boston with us.
How many men named Tom do you know?
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble.
I am good.
If you are a parent, don't allow yourself to set your heart on any particular line of work for your children.
It's a pity that you couldn't come.
I am waiting for the store to open.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
Are you going to buy a dictionary?
Let's not forget that Tom is only thirteen years old.
There's no reason to change our plans.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
There is little hope that she will come on time.
You're not that old.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
Come and get it.
He didn't want to sell the book.
This was my idea.
The situation has stabilized.
All I want is your love.
You're probably thirsty.
I recommended Tom for the job.
Give me the car keys.
Why are you so cheerful?
I'm fascinated.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't like it.
I have so much to show you.
You're very understanding.
She's six years older than I am.
I should've known it was a scam.
I am doubtful whether he will come.
Some people questioned his honesty.
We found all the boxes empty.
Please sit on this chair and wait.
You told Tom not to come, didn't you?
I love your daughter.
We're here, too.
This task took three hours.
I think I'm going back to sleep.
I hate dogs.
We will soon be having snow.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
She made him do it.
Anyone can do it as long as they try.
How much does that cost?
I wish you could come with us.
I cut class.
I want to teach history when I grow up.
Tom was bitten by a cobra.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
I've caught a cold.
I'm fed up with this weather.
Where are the bags from Flight 57?
Don't buy me presents anymore.
Would you like some more salad?
I'm not blushing!
I want my key back.
Stay here all night if you want.
This bed is cold.
I don't need your help anymore.
I didn't hear much.
There are downsides to being pretty.
Can you help me?
He was absent because of the storm.
Having a full time job and raising two kids at the same time is hard.
You're the one who planted that tree.
I have never heard her sing.
I really think you should leave.
This computer is powerful, efficient, and easy to use.
