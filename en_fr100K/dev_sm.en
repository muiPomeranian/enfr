I like living here.
I'm confident.
I don't recognize the number.
Tom reads a lot of books.
This whole affair stinks to high heaven.
I need you for just a second.
Do I look presentable?
You're far too young to be doing this.
They were very excited.
They invited me to the party.
There's no damage.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
We are going to his house. Want to come with?
Are you still recovering from last night?
Help yourself.
You're the oldest.
Tom was third.
Nothing will take me away from you.
Have you ever been run over?
Don't talk!
You were terrified, weren't you?
You're very angry.
What do I have to do to convince you?
Do you prefer meat or fish?
I'm happy to see you in one piece.
I must have made a mistake.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
Not all of them are present.
I'll look after your child while you are away.
You've got to be bold!
He is always day-dreaming.
Don't be so impatient.
She takes after her father.
It's a stupid rule.
Is it true?
Tom wouldn't have done that.
Please be careful.
We often took a walk along the seashore together in the morning.
Don't be afraid to try new things.
Tom knows that won't work.
Who is that woman?
How long are you going to keep giving me the silent treatment?
My parents are old.
The mechanic fixed my car without charging me a dime.
There are some things that you should never try doing.
Keep away from the dog.
You're not very good.
Please eat some cake.
Do we need to bring our dictionaries to class tomorrow?
Freedom is so fundamental that its importance cannot be overemphasized.
She says that she likes flowers.
There are many parks in Boston.
Someone's taken my umbrella.
I'm not your son.
Are you blackmailing me?
Come over to my place.
Tom has a sister named Mary.
Space travel is no longer a dream.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary so much.
It was a very cold winter.
It was a stroke of genius.
I had the same problem when I was your age.
The girl had grown up without any money and when she married she became a spendthrift.
I need to know who you are.
Why did you come home so late?
I don't know what I know.
Tom put on his coat and left.
Tom is really weird.
I agree to this plan.
How much did you win?
I don't know how to use a VCR.
Could I borrow your eyeliner?
The more you look, the more you will see, and the more interesting they will become.
Is this all they do?
They hung streamers from the ceiling in preparation for the party.
Where is it hidden?
Do you want a ticket?
You're tough.
Tom hit a home run.
Tom got an emergency call and had to leave work.
I wonder what it could be.
Can you imagine what life will be like for them now?
Everybody's so busy.
I played an interesting game of chess against the computer last week.
I always have trouble remembering names.
How are you?
He traveled around the country.
How did you get the idea?
How good is he?
Tom shut the door and locked it.
He does not seem to be able to catch on to what she is saying.
Moral leadership is more powerful than any weapon.
Tell Tom that I'm exhausted.
The Giants beat the Lions yesterday.
I plan to go skiing with my girlfriend.
Did I say something stupid?
Snap out of it!
Tom's sweating.
I like going to the movies.
My sister saw it with her own eyes.
It looks as if you're right.
Do you ever think about that guy?
I love you more and more every day.
No kidding?
She's married to a foreigner.
I suddenly feel sick.
I'll give it to you.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Tom said Mary was happy.
Do you know Latin?
Do we have a babysitter for tonight?
Tom has three million dollars in the bank.
It seems it'll rain tomorrow.
I saw a black cat run into the house.
Most public places are simply not geared to people with disabilities.
I guess you are right.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
I took it for granted that she had received my letter.
He was surprised by the news.
We went to Rome, where we stayed a week.
The old man was starved to death.
Are you sure about this?
I ran for mayor.
I didn't know that Tom was Mary's son.
I saw her home.
I haven't tried doing it that way.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Tom is quite authoritative.
You don't really want that, do you?
It's not worth worrying about it.
Let's not waste our money.
Sing me a song.
A man's body dies, but his soul is immortal.
I think we should get out here.
I remember reading about it.
No one knew what to do.
Tom is at Mary's home.
You're a terrible person.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I never thought about that.
She is now staying at her uncle's house.
Tom is good at biology.
My mother is crazy.
He got a broken jaw and lost some teeth.
Help yourself to the cake.
I like spending time with you.
We're interfering.
You're the master.
That's what's wrong with you.
A cat can see in the dark.
You are a student.
This is getting weirder.
My boys are all grown up.
You're ambitious.
Why do people hate Tom so much?
You can't be too careful when you drive a car.
What are you doing tomorrow?
She died.
I don't want to be different.
I dreamed that I was buying this guitar.
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
What did she whisper to you?
My uncle has completely recovered from his illness.
You'd better listen to me.
You're almost as tall as Tom.
I caused an accident.
He borrowed the car from his friend.
Our team did not reach the playoffs this year.
Who are you afraid of?
Do you mind much?
This looks like a gunshot wound.
I don't have an answer.
A rat chewed a hole in the wall.
My approach is different.
It's impossible to reason with a drunk.
He adopted the orphan.
It was a stupid idea.
If you keep harping on his flaws, he'll grow to resent you.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
That's a nice dress.
I believe congratulations are in order.
The door of the office is yellow.
I want to tell you about my problems.
I want you back.
Teenagers are often embarrassed to be seen in public with their parents.
There's nothing down here.
I suppose you love him.
Please sit down for a moment.
It hadn't crossed my mind.
Happy holidays.
He preferred working to doing nothing.
I'm not saying that you're not beautiful.
I love you both.
Thank you for this report.
I really need to go home and catch some zees.
I am responsible for her protection.
The scandal ruined his career.
Is it hot over there?
The weather is bad.
You said you were happy.
I didn't know why I wasn't supposed to go to that part of town.
I didn't know that would happen.
I can't recall who said that.
I believe what is written in her letter.
You can see the whole park from the restaurant.
I really can't make any promises.
Tom works all night.
Tom didn't give me back my money.
I will call you tomorrow afternoon.
You don't have to wait until the end.
I can't stand fishing.
This is a pretty amazing place.
I'm satisfied with the results.
I'm not obese.
Bring your children along.
Let's run to the bus stop.
We can't be sure about that, can we?
We must look at the problem from a global point of view.
Let's talk to Tom about that.
I don't know yet, but I'll find out soon enough.
Our train is late.
Help me and I will help you.
You're not supposed to be in here.
Would you like to switch seats?
What's the tallest building in Boston?
I suppose you're already packed and ready to go.
I have evidence.
It was just stupid.
No one could solve the puzzle.
Where did you go to school?
He's a cheat and a liar.
I'm starving.
I'm a doctor now.
I've always dreamed of owning my own business.
Who do you think you're talking to here?
Is there a picture of Tom in that album?
Let's hit the road.
I saw my reflection in the window.
I think it's dangerous.
Perhaps you would have preferred a French dish.
She lives in this neighborhood.
You've forgotten me, haven't you?
I hope it helps.
I need a pencil sharpener.
Are you sure everything's OK?
I like it that way.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
I have to dress up.
Nobody else was there.
People say that he is the richest man in this town.
He has ants in his pants.
Call me back.
I'm sick of being sick.
Whatever you do, don't forget this.
I'd like to go, too.
You won't be the first.
Tom can't play a high G on his trumpet, but he can play an F.
Can you go faster?
Tom needs this.
You mean a lot to me.
No one heard anything.
I almost left my umbrella in the train.
He stays a long time every time he comes.
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.
They got into the train.
I haven't eaten anything all day, but I don't feel hungry.
We were right.
I have always fed my dog the dog food that comes in the big green bag.
Could you please clear the table?
Tom asked Mary whether she'd like to go shopping.
Tom is dreaming again.
She has a wonderful personality.
That's a good picture of you.
No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't please him.
We used to play musical chairs in elementary school.
I waited for him till ten.
For me, they are the best.
Tom, you've grown so fast.
I'm ready now, Tom.
What is aspirin made of?
The family is the most basic unit of society.
Will you join our club?
Is this one the bus for Oxford?
I heard that Tom doesn't sing anymore.
I want more detailed information.
Are you up to the task?
I'll be careful with the kids.
What do you intend to do with the money?
Do you know anyone here?
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
My wife is a vegetarian.
What browser are you using?
I nailed it.
He doesn't read many newspapers.
I want to learn how to ski.
That is a pencil.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
Don't ask me.
This place is arguably the best restaurant in London.
He hates himself.
Did you grow up in Boston?
All are present.
I bet you're a great teacher.
She pressured him to quit his job.
This question has often come up.
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
I think I broke his heart.
Is this place far from the bank?
Do you like to drink beer?
Tom talked about Boston.
What are your qualification?
This is insoluble in water.
For someone who's supposed to be an expert, you don't seem to know much.
Will you do me a favor?
She really hates this way of thinking.
If you translate from your second language into your own native language, rather than the other way around, you're less likely to make mistakes.
I'm doing my best.
Where should we do that?
He selected a pair of socks to match his suit.
I got dizzy.
It was all your imagination.
He congratulated me on my success.
The project is not going well.
He is less strict than our teacher.
We don't live in a perfect world.
I eat alone.
I figured I could be of some help.
The food is horrible.
I speak a few languages.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Can somebody get that?
It's silent.
The girls are excited.
I'm through with my work. Let's go out.
He's a southpaw.
I smiled and waved at them.
Should we have some lunch?
I know how busy you've been.
Don't jump to any conclusions.
I'd like to think about it.
There's no class today.
You should buy it for yourself.
She glanced around.
Does anyone have a picture of this?
Not knowing what to do, I did nothing.
I am more beautiful than you.
You can't keep this a secret.
He couldn't pass the entrance examination.
I didn't go to school yesterday.
Without you, life is awful.
Tom changed his diet.
Tom is reading a book.
Have you finished your French homework yet?
He's doing it right.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
What a horrible man!
I want you to keep your eyes open.
You're so sweet.
It's not why I'm here.
His sudden death was a tragedy.
Fortunately, common sense prevailed and the strike was called off.
Who were you talking with?
Do whatever you want about it.
I have lost my wallet.
Let's jump into the water.
We noticed the man enter her room.
It's bedtime.
I'm going to call it a night.
She is deaf to my advice.
I thought Tom was going to be here.
You're a thief.
She cleared the dishes from the table after dinner.
Everybody paid.
My father encouraged me to learn how to play the piano.
I prefer not to discuss it here.
I'll get rid of it.
How are you connected?
What are you reading?
When I was a college student, I always pulled all-nighters before tests.
I'm not thinking clearly.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
Please tell Tom that Mary called.
Someone's coming.
What happens next?
Does he have any brothers?
Once you have made a promise, you should keep it.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
It's very easy to use.
Of course.
Please close the door.
I want to be more independent.
This is the culmination of years of work.
You can go to the station by bus.
Being very tired, I soon fell asleep.
Tom checked the date.
Tom waited for Mary for a long time.
Can you identify the man using this picture?
Nobody wants to work.
What exactly is this?
It's been three years since I've seen Tom.
I just want to help you.
Why are we still talking about this?
Any play opening to bad reviews won't last long.
I stopped to smoke.
Will you be in Boston this weekend?
Tell me.
It's fun to ride a motorcycle.
Please add my name to the list.
I love blackberries.
We arrived first.
I must go.
Have you ever thought about becoming a teacher?
Take a look.
You passed the test.
He finally met my demands.
I know a good lawyer who can help you.
The dog looks hungry.
The rule only applies to foreigners.
You can't live without water.
He can't be older than me.
I guess I fell asleep.
Do you play in a band?
You are important.
I left my tennis racket on the train.
It is not necessary for us to attend the meeting.
He was beside himself with joy.
No way!
Are you vegetarian?
The honeymoon is over.
She followed him home; then killed him.
Summer vacation is soon.
I thought the questions were easy.
Everybody started cheering.
That would be unreasonable.
I slept only three hours.
What's not to like?
I did just like you asked.
Tom threw an empty beer can at Mary.
They study in the afternoon.
Tom is a moron.
Why not apply for that job?
I thought I saw a ghost.
It's not far to Boston.
His face turned white.
Did she have a hard time?
They are vegetarians.
Thank you for the wonderful meal.
We have arrived safe and sound.
Can I make a reservation for golf?
Tom asked Mary if he could borrow her bicycle.
My father planted this tree on the day I was born.
Tom wants you to go to Boston with him.
I don't have them yet.
He shook his son by the shoulder.
We will make up for the loss.
What a total idiot!
I don't want to see it.
He offered more than could be expected.
I never had to worry about money.
Don't move, or I'll shoot you.
We have a lot of work ahead of us.
I love the way you talk.
Your ideas are weird.
Hand me that phone.
There is only space for thirty students in this classroom.
I can't remember exactly.
You don't have to go.
I already have an envelope.
This is my final offer.
He has a fertile imagination.
I sleep in my room.
I want to know exactly what you did.
The ring couldn't be found anywhere.
Do you like playing sports?
Why can't we do that?
It would be prudent to worry about the details now.
Well, it's complicated.
You're very wise.
What would you like to be called?
I find foreign languages very interesting.
No matter how fast you may walk, you can't catch up with him.
She decided not to go.
It's time to get serious.
How long will it take?
Mathematics is basic to all sciences.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
He turned over in bed.
I don't care about your past.
I wish you'd talk to me.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
I need your full attention now.
Mary looked beautiful to Tom.
They are out shopping.
I've worked very hard.
I promise you I'll stay with you until your father arrives.
I didn't see anything strange.
I think you should leave now.
I knew it would be painful.
I was too tired to go on.
I'm still your friend.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I'd like to stand.
I know what I did.
We're not fit.
I want to take a walk.
Hold still.
Is there a problem with your hearing?
I have no family.
Do you know what he said?
I have an umbrella in my car.
Tom is a good person.
It may seem odd.
That might not be a good idea.
Luckily nobody drowned.
I am fed up with his vulgar jokes.
I will leave it to your judgement.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
Stop acting like a child.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
I almost stepped on a skunk last night.
They're both right.
Music is a gift from God.
Let's get in the truck.
You take your job too seriously.
He stood by me whenever I was in trouble.
I would like to get to know you better.
Make me a better offer.
All you have to do is sit down here and answer the doctor's questions.
We're not perfect.
I want to say this the right way.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
It's my treat.
"Natto" smells awful, but tastes delicious.
I don't like dogs.
I'm not well.
Would you like me to get you something to eat?
I have been to the airport to see him off.
He only paid ten dollars for that shirt.
Can I come some other time?
You have gone too far this time.
You look surprised.
Do you like dogs?
She decided to be a doctor.
I obeyed the rules.
Don't waste your time in a dead-end relationship.
Is it not a bit extreme?
I hardly slept last night.
I have to tell her that the phone rang while she was gone.
Were you two close?
Perhaps it will snow tomorrow.
He always works hard.
You can't be sure of that.
I'll get you whatever you want.
I never said that.
Where exactly did you go?
Do you know what your kids are eating?
Not all birds can fly.
We're going to have to work together.
She works with single-minded determination.
Monkeys climb trees.
We have faith in Tom.
The snow has begun melting.
They are very big.
Tom pressed a hidden button.
I was deeply impressed by his speech.
You can't ride a horse.
Hold your breath, please.
You're very helpful.
How will I pay my debts now?
They're all safe.
She finished the job with ease.
Occasionally, things don't go as planned.
We'll all be there together.
The ceremony was held in honor of the guest from China.
He brought food to his guest and provided him shelter.
Some of the crew were drowned.
How tall you are!
He was absent from school because he was sick.
You're not entirely wrong.
I have to admit that you're right.
It only costs $10.00!
Why exactly did you do that?
Tom is fatter than when I last saw him.
I watched the movie.
Things were never quite the same after that.
I'd like to see that ring, please.
We want to know where you stand.
It's easy to make and it's cheap.
Can we talk in private?
He could not hold back his tears.
I have no one to talk to.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
I am from France.
I don't care what color ink, just bring me a pen.
I'll kill you.
I need this more than you.
I made a phone call.
He's about the same age as you are.
I started the fire.
You've made your point.
How I've missed you!
This movie is frightening to the children.
The work must be completed by tomorrow.
You're very wise.
A cat came out from under the desk.
How are we going to pay for that?
Did you get the flowers?
How do you know I don't know?
Success depends mostly on effort.
Where does that bus go?
I might as well get a head start.
Anybody can become famous.
Tom has been smiling all day.
I'm used to it.
I want to see your boss.
I love you just as you are.
We're late because of you.
Are they going to arrest Tom?
We'll talk again in the morning.
It's all wet.
Which one will you choose?
It was not until recently that she changed her mind.
I hope that what you are eating is healthy.
He will be back in a day or two.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
I gave you what you asked for.
Are you ready for the trip?
How's the water here?
Something happened.
She talked him into buying her a diamond ring.
I got her to wash dishes.
You're not my friend.
You're always nagging me.
He is sadly mistaken.
How's your wife doing?
Remove your hat.
Now let's celebrate.
You're not dressed.
They have the same habits.
Life can be hard.
Where is the most beautiful place in the world?
Is anything broken?
They're wrong.
He's got a boy-next-door look about him.
Tom folded his shirts.
You cannot do this.
It's a good start, don't you think?
Only love can break your heart.
Look up the number in the telephone book.
I just want you to think about that.
I'll turn it into a house.
You might want to try it sometime.
How soon are you going shopping?
Tom isn't very spontaneous, is he?
I'm going to shut up now.
Are you leaving now?
I want to know where you heard that.
Business is very good now.
They despise you.
When's dinner served?
She is very cynical about life.
The professor is making a phone call.
I didn't break it.
This is a very special night.
Because my mother was ill, I could not go there.
Tom doesn't take very good care of his dog.
Can you please look the other way?
I heard screaming.
The children broke the ancient urn.
He will always be with you.
Trust no one.
Tom doesn't even like driving.
I feel like this isn't going to end well.
I've studied French, remember?
Fear washed across the stock market.
Be careful on your way back home.
Do you think I don't care?
The pizza tasted good.
This gate allows access to the garden.
Forget it.
What happened after that?
She eats nothing but vegetables.
Just as he was going out, there was a great earthquake.
Everything was difficult.
It's starting to snow.
How much is it?
You're very upset.
They have explosives.
Hello everyone!
Let's take the bus.
He earns his living by playing the piano.
It's very hot, isn't it?
Are you sincere?
That's not my job.
What was her name?
What does it contain?
You're going to be OK.
I didn't want to spend any more time alone.
I hope we didn't wake you.
I don't consider that adequate.
We'll all be hungry, so be sure to bring enough food for everyone.
Are you referring to me?
Are they still in bed?
Who says Tom knew?
Who else knows I'm here?
Do you think you'll be here tomorrow?
I had a good dream last night.
I'm not flexible enough to sit in the lotus position.
Come home as soon as you can.
If the phone rings again, I will ignore it.
Life without books is unimaginable.
Tom bought a leather couch.
He is not what he used to be.
I'm the boss.
She came into the room.
Are you losing weight?
That's what I'm asking you to do.
You have something of mine.
Please sign this receipt.
What's this street called?
We're slowing down.
My wife is a good manager.
It looks like we're in for some nasty weather.
Were you nervous during the job interview?
A cat has nine lives.
Are you telling me the truth?
Maybe that's a good idea.
Mary is divorced.
Tom only had eyes for Mary.
Even though she was a heavy woman, she danced well.
Spring fever is not a disease.
Tom pulled a box from under the bed.
She has gone, but I still love her.
We have homework.
Tie your shoelaces.
What fun!
I'm Canadian, too.
Perhaps Tom won't go to Boston.
Stay absolutely still.
I have no idea what that could be.
They're dying.
What year were you born?
I did nothing unlawful.
What is your idea of a good time?
They arrived just in time for the last train.
I asked him not to drive so fast.
You're very intelligent.
He speaks English with a German accent.
You're restless.
The opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel.
How long will it take me to walk to the station?
I'll walk out with you.
Don't make me do this.
I'm the boss around here.
What time will dinner be served?
Tom kissed Mary good night.
I didn't hear you come in.
You are so cute.
He's a slowpoke.
I believe that he comes here.
There he is.
Do we have to take the bus?
Feel this. It's really soft.
She gave him a book.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
It's natural for family members to help each other.
What would you call that?
It was his best time.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
I want time instead of money.
She was on the point of going out.
Let's head for that tall tree.
Tom didn't even have the courtesy to say that he was sorry.
Do you have a problem with what was suggested?
Jeans go with everything.
In hindsight, this was a mistake.
She made him happy.
Because of his wealth, he was able to become a member of that club.
She raised an important objection to his argument.
He's not at home.
You have a great imagination.
Many consider seven to be a lucky number.
He is anything but a gentleman.
It's an old custom.
He sees nothing wrong with it.
I miss my cat.
You can go back.
You may sit.
I finished writing a letter in English.
My watch loses five minutes a day.
They don't know my name.
That's the point.
Let's look at what the report says.
We plan to stay a week.
I've spent all the money.
She shook her head.
Nobody had to tell Tom. He already knew.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
What time does the next train leave?
In France, voting isn't mandatory.
He was almost drowned.
Something wasn't right.
Tom called to say that he'll be late.
Frankly, I don't like that man.
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
Where do we even begin?
Do you know us?
I'm not a fool.
I've had a wonderful time here.
I can't carry on like this.
Did you like it?
Why did you come here?
He was punished for drunken driving.
His birthday is May 5th.
He never told anyone.
You will be able to play tennis better soon.
A dreary landscape spread out for miles in all directions.
Tom might be able to fix that.
These are counterfeit.
It is an option.
There are fifteen people here, counting the guests.
The pond is very deep.
We'll always be friends.
Where is it hidden?
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
Is that another joke?
You're preaching to the choir.
I'm happy you liked it.
I saw Tom naked.
You don't have the ticket.
Let's try doing this again.
I'm assuming this is your father.
Grammar is a very complex thing.
I didn't meet him again after that.
I liked working with you.
I won't pretend I'm sorry.
I didn't have the heart to tell him the truth.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
I hate this kind of place.
All the boys looked down.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I will, too.
I believe in my abilities.
I know that better than anybody.
I flushed the toilet.
Life is sweet.
That's not how I feel.
You are taller than me.
Tom is lucky to still be alive.
I'm on duty.
Elephants were killed for their ivory.
Are you planning to stay?
He was re-elected mayor.
A boat suddenly appeared out of the mist.
Let me smell your breath.
It was less than fifteen dollars.
I don't know what it is.
We're all done.
I wonder what the average weight of a strawberry is.
I trust her.
Leave that to me.
Are you already married?
Lying to Tom was a mistake.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
We have to postpone our departure.
I hurried in order not to be late for school.
Have you ever given money to a beggar?
The weather is terrible today.
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
I want to talk to you about this report.
Go get some water.
This is foolish.
My three-year-old niece kissed me on the cheek.
Is Mary a real blonde?
Your pitching is far superior to mine.
Let's talk about this later.
January is the first month of the year.
Let Tom stay home.
Some were farmers, some were hunters.
You may choose any of them.
You've been selected.
Are you enjoying this?
I am tired of hearing it.
Tom claimed that it was an accident.
A green banana is not ripe enough to eat.
Your car is fast.
Tom gave me back my dictionary.
It snowed for ten consecutive days.
Let me write down the directions for you.
I thought everyone knew.
His appearance deceived me.
I gave you fair warning.
We had a secret meeting.
Are you freaking out?
I'm dieting.
She can hardly speak Japanese.
The Kiso River is often called the Rhine of Japan.
We're all the same.
This really is something.
I refused to pay.
Don't read in this room.
I am losing my patience with you.
Don't talk nonsense.
I knew you were behind it.
He studies ten hours a day on average.
I will have him come.
You stick out like a sore thumb.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Tom isn't able to come today.
I haven't seen her since last month.
I'd like to book three seats.
Check out what I've been up to.
The medicine didn't do me any good.
I knew it was just a misunderstanding.
I had left the key in the office the day before.
Do you go to school by bus?
We need somebody with bold new ideas.
I took a painkiller for my headache.
It pays in the long run to buy goods of high quality.
Who do you think would do such a thing?
I saw the figure of a man.
What a waste of energy!
He showed me the way to the store.
His behavior spoke volumes about his upbringing.
I did not know this.
I never trusted Tom.
I'll show you the car I've just bought.
Perhaps we should discuss this later.
He is unrealistic.
I can't see.
I don't like your boss.
He is apt to forget his promise.
This road curves gently to the right.
That's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
Smith died of a heart attack.
How was the universe formed?
The statistics gave ammunition to her argument.
The thief got away with the money.
She assured him that everything was OK.
How many times have you lied to me?
No kidding?
He skipped a grade.
She told me which clothes would be good to wear.
His wife is worn out after looking after the children.
I was very tired today.
This is the important part.
The faster we rub our hands together, the warmer they get.
Here is the fish my mother baked.
Turn in your homework.
Did you make this?
They're not here yet.
I just want to help you relax.
No matter what you say, I won't give up.
You're never going to believe what happened today.
What do you do for a living?
You came too late.
Tom felt great.
Are you looking for somebody?
Can you handle it?
Why don't you go talk to him?
The man in charge of the merry-go-round decided to make sure everything was working properly.
Are you over your cold yet?
You may be needed.
I'll take you to the hospital.
They're cute.
She wrote me a long letter.
Our school is larger than theirs.
Tom is a bachelor.
I have a lot of money in my savings account.
I knew this day would come.
She is making dinner.
I want to stay in the house.
The doctor examined my throat.
They're hiding in the woods.
"The phone is ringing." "I'll get it."
Tom bought me everything I wanted.
I'd be careful.
I'm delighted.
The number of cases of whooping cough is on the rise in the last years.
What did you get hit with?
They were low enough in cost so many Americans could buy them.
She was stupid enough to go out with him.
Do you mind if I don't do this?
Do you know how long they have been married?
You're bright.
This was part of the plan.
I love my daughter.
They've all gone crazy.
I know you considered me a close friend.
How did you get into Harvard?
I've seen that.
Everyone is going.
It's a large one.
He is afraid of his grandfather.
I feel silly.
Tom isn't qualified for that job.
Keep your hands up.
We have no school tomorrow.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Where's the bag?
I live here alone.
It's a complete disaster.
I have a schedule.
You seem angry.
I was frustrated.
Can you help me with Japanese?
Who did you vote for?
Lesson Two is easy.
He gave a nice present to me.
A little rest would do us a lot of good.
I think she is good at dancing.
I have an orange and an apple.
You will soon get used to speaking in public.
I'd like to see that ring, please.
Tom couldn't get his shoes off.
I'm pretty sure Tom lives on Park Street.
I wonder if there's a market for something like that.
You look smart.
They found out.
Are you ready to begin?
He should be in charge.
That's what I want to do.
I haven't eaten lunch yet.
I remember when I first saw you.
She is a pretty girl.
I don't need you to wait for me.
You are so childish sometimes.
It is very short.
I did it for you.
I just want to have fun.
He left the motor running.
You can't charge that much.
I drink three or four cups of coffee a day.
I was present at the meeting.
You'll find something that interests you.
We had to react quickly.
I feel very relaxed.
It appears that he is a musician.
I can't do this job without you.
Who takes care of you?
She was brushing her hair in front of a mirror.
I ought to punch you for saying that.
Answer me right now.
I really am sorry.
You can't do both at the same time.
Are you enjoying your weekend?
They were punished for their crimes.
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
Shall we go and eat?
More is not always better.
I like this.
I know what to ignore.
Tom enjoyed the movie.
Some boats are on the lake.
Everybody is supposed to know the law, but few people really do.
We're survivors.
What did you want to talk to me about?
She has a strong dislike of insects.
Keep an eye on him.
"Thanks for the help." "Don't mention it."
The lamp was suspended from the branch of a tree.
You're a wonderful friend.
I don't want you to be upset.
I don't want to think about what could have happened.
Don't blame the messenger.
Do you mind if I tag along?
He gave me a hard time.
She made him a cake for his party.
It's just not safe.
Tom and Mary mailed wedding invitations to all of their friends.
My children live in Boston.
The results are by no means satisfactory.
Tom said that Mary wasn't satisfied.
There was a steady increase in population.
How good are you?
Tom is already waiting.
It took me several hours to draw it.
Are you writing a letter?
We did it.
Here's your change.
He went to bed.
Welcome back.
You must consider what kind of work you want to do.
I don't understand why this has to be done.
Would you mind if I went home early?
This could become a big problem.
My father works in a factory.
You are old enough to know this.
Promise me that you'll help Tom.
"Have you ever been to New York?" "Yes, I've been there a couple of times."
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom probably didn't do the work himself.
She has no one to speak to.
One of them is probably lying.
I had it all planned.
Tom isn't busy right now.
I don't think I said that.
I never thought about that.
Take a few days off.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I saw the two together on several occasions.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
I haven't decided yet if I want to go.
You have to obey the law.
Your troubles are just beginning.
Do it the way he tells you to.
He has a natural bent for music.
What shall we buy him for his birthday?
I am looking forward to your letter.
Tom went home at 6:30.
Would you like me to do that for you?
Take your umbrella with you in case it rains.
Everyone is outraged.
I feel kind of tired.
I hope he will come up with a new and good idea.
I live in Tokyo.
I blame you for this, Tom.
Why are you interested?
Concentration is a very simple thing.
Do you know all these people?
I'd like to be a teacher.
It's high time you were in bed.
I went there yesterday.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
We were told to stop doing that.
Call if you need anything.
My brother hung the picture upside down.
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
Tom's question was an accusation.
Who was the book written by?
I saw Tom kill the neighbor's cat.
Does this look good on me?
I've received it too.
Do you want to touch it?
Can you promise me you won't do that?
Do you own research.
I had no place else to go.
You won't believe this.
I don't want you to be upset.
She was on verge of fainting.
You have gone too far this time.
I don't care who Tom is talking to.
Miami is the biggest city in Florida.
Has the climate changed?
He heard the sound.
I didn't think you'd believe me.
A smart dog never barks for no reason.
Don't give up hope.
I had only one drink.
I want to know who told you that.
I can't be seen with you.
Tom handed Mary a banana.
I couldn't make him understand my English.
Do you feel like a drink?
Put on the hat.
You do not have to take your umbrella with you.
Is there anywhere you want to go?
A really bad thing happened to him.
I want your name and badge number.
Someone will do it.
I get up at six.
You're still alive.
We made it out of there.
I've decided to go a little further.
That never was an issue.
It looks like you've regained your confidence.
I sat down next to him.
My boss is a slave driver.
May I have a glass of wine, please?
I did my best to prevent this.
I drink my tea without sugar.
It's too difficult.
I just had a talk with your lawyer.
Personally, I think you're right.
He is never lazy.
You must make up for the loss.
Tom had reasons to be angry.
This shop carries men's clothing.
I'm touched.
I stopped smoking once and for all.
That's the car I told you about.
Why didn't you just leave?
She goes to market every day to buy things.
Have you ever sung in public?
I don't have anything to say to you.
I made that decision on my own.
The automobile industry is one of the main industries in Japan.
Could we have a spoon?
I'm not even sure if this is my key.
Look out of the window.
I stuck my hands in my pockets.
We just want Tom to keep working.
I don't want to handle it.
That's a blatant lie.
She accompanied him to Japan.
They grow strawberries in their greenhouse.
Could I talk to the two of you alone?
I thought they'd heard us.
He solved the problem with ease.
Just keep moving.
I'm sure he mistook me for my sister.
I hate to see you so miserable.
Bird watching is a nice hobby.
Wait here.
I'm baking!
He lives frugally.
I'll join you in a moment.
I hope we can still be friends.
Don't you think it odd that she was in such a hurry?
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria.
Stop whining like a baby.
I must have made a mistake.
I wish you had done what I asked you to do.
Tom doesn't have Mary's address in Boston, but he has her phone number.
Did you notice that Tom wasn't wearing his wedding ring today?
Let me do the talking.
Let's face the facts!
I refuse to be treated like a slave by you.
He never gave way to temptation.
I can hardly breathe.
I promised I wasn't going to do this.
Hurry up, girls.
Press the green button. If you do so, the light will go on.
I remember mentioning it once or twice.
I hope you're well paid.
She smiled at her baby.
He stood up and took a deep breath.
I am here.
I'm sure I can persuade Tom.
This is an entirely new problem.
How far is it from here to the museum?
In a way you are right, but I still have doubts.
Tom has serious health problems.
He is supposed to be at home today.
My parents persuaded me not to travel alone.
Tom was going to help us.
Tom can't buy himself a car.
You never stop, do you?
They were responsible for the accident.
I felt great.
No one would listen.
I made friends with them at the school festival.
I burned it.
There is a cat under the bed.
Are you going to have dinner at home?
Cows give us milk.
No one can help me.
I forgot to telephone him today.
Where were the others?
I've heard a lot about you.
I would do it again.
Mary had bare shoulders.
Don't be so lazy.
It's merely a joke.
The plane is approaching New York.
He ran away when he saw the policeman.
Tom was your French teacher, wasn't he?
You should get some exercise.
There is a lot of food left.
He is inclined to look at everything from the standpoint of its practicality and is neither stingy nor extravagant.
I don't even know where to start looking.
Everybody here knows me.
You're skinny.
My girlfriend is crying.
I can't stand kids.
She would not follow my advice.
Let him in.
Are you retired, Tom?
I don't really have a gun.
His eyes failed him.
If you're tired, rest.
Tom is a monster.
Sorry, I was busy.
My room is very small.
Tom has a new girlfriend already.
You will always be in my heart.
We discussed the matter.
I figured everyone was hungry.
The well ran dry.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
He often falls in love.
Wait until your father gets home.
He married a rich girl.
He's dating my daughter.
I knew something wasn't right.
I think you should see this.
How do you plan to help me?
We spent hours trying to solve the problem.
I didn't even know that my car had been stolen.
If you start now, you will get there in time.
Have you ever ridden in a hot air balloon?
They called him a coward.
I'm sick of conferences these days.
I'll set you free.
What did you do last Sunday?
The fight lasted three seconds.
Where exactly did you go?
I'll talk to you later.
He wants to reach a wider audience.
You're not welcome here.
We're doing everything we can for Tom.
How far are you prepared to go?
How could they not know?
The place was almost empty.
We're going in first.
I would like to read some books about Lincoln.
Bring a camera.
I have two cousins.
I was too astonished to speak.
We ate some apples.
Does anybody need anything?
How many kinds of vegetables do you grow in your garden?
I feel like having an ice cream.
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
He boasted about his skills.
He demanded better pay.
It's what he painted.
You should follow your teacher's advice.
A home is more than a mere building.
You seem busy.
Do you have some money?
She has many dogs.
Since you're tired, you should rest.
Wait a while.
We were all a little tired.
It's too dark to play outside.
I've found a good job.
No one's gambling.
Tom will likely accept your offer.
He blamed me for the accident.
Anything can happen.
You can see the whole city from this hill.
This is between you and me.
She explained to him why she couldn't visit him.
Do you want us to take you with us?
Elephants are the world's largest land animals.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I asked Tom why he had never gotten married.
We've had lot of complaints.
Tom prefers not to talk about it.
Which one's the new one?
She liked that.
I think skateboards are usually cheaper than rollerblades.
He decided to quit smoking.
I run before breakfast every morning.
I'm doing my homework.
She was a bundle of nerves last night.
This is mine.
It'll be easy.
I knew I'd find you here.
I think I understand it.
I only read the first three chapters.
I bet you're right.
Turn the lights out now.
Anybody wanna grab something to eat with me?
It never occurred to me that he loved me.
I've been trying to get a hold of you for the past two hours.
Who are we competing against?
The boss is very upset.
She's no singer.
Blind people read by touching, using a system of raised dots called Braille.
We're comedians.
Tom is drunk.
What do you want to eat for lunch?
Why aren't you listening?
I go to the office by bicycle except on rainy days.
I got fined.
I speak a little Spanish.
We must take care of the elderly.
My father is busy.
I heard my phone ring.
He beckoned me to follow him.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
The company is in the red.
I'll do whatever it takes to get you back.
I want you to be my friend again.
Columbus discovered America in 1492.
We're looking for a place to sleep.
I found it easy to answer the question.
They talked over the plan for hours.
We found that everyone was asleep.
Let's be clear.
Everybody knew Tom could speak French well.
I can't figure out how to delete what I just posted.
I don't think I could forgive myself if I did that.
Judging from the look of the sky, it is likely to rain.
I'm going to start over.
I know exactly where I am.
He has a lot of money.
Did you like the movie?
I maxed out my credit card.
I like her very much.
She didn't reply.
He turned around.
We know where you were.
I want a piece of cake.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
I could hear everything the president said.
Tom wondered how long it would take to finish the job.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
Many people are skeptical.
My father does not like music.
I can't believe you're trying to bribe me.
I want you to remember this moment.
I don't mind a bit.
What does this look like to you?
I don't feel sorry for you.
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
Do you think we'll have good weather?
I always travel with travelers' checks instead of cash.
Who called you?
What do you say you join me for dinner?
Why did you do all this?
Let's have a look.
Tom gathered wood for the fire.
How many hours of sleep do you need?
I like to ride on trains.
What's your name again?
You're incorrigible.
Tom will do that sooner or later.
These shoes are a little loose.
We'll be at home all day today.
I don't see what the big deal is.
You're very pretty.
You can't deny that.
Do you think we will get there on time?
Let's get rid of that one.
She pressured him to quit.
They have an extra bed.
Don't lose sleep over that.
The lock must be broken.
We aren't married.
He wanted to be a great military leader.
You're conceited.
Quit complaining.
This book is both interesting and instructive.
I reckon you should do it.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
Don't you just love it here?
She disappeared in the dark.
I am willing to help you.
It's a proven fact.
That's no problem.
We haven't finished.
The moon is already out.
I can survive alone.
We'll decide later.
He has not been able to attend school for a week.
Just tell him the truth.
I want some answers.
I don't want to do that without you.
When did you become a teacher?
Is it hard to speak English?
I can't accept your gift.
I want you to tell me how to do this.
I wanted to make you feel at home.
That's what we're working on.
He is a kind boy.
Who painted this painting?
I will meet you at the station at 10 a.m.
May I eat a little of it?
My sister can't start the day without reading her horoscope.
I didn't vote.
Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
Can you still remember the time we first met?
I'll tell you exactly what to say.
Let's do that together.
Who knows what's going to happen?
Take care of yourselves!
I want to see you first.
You're not alone anymore.
I said he could go.
Your question is not relevant to the subject.
The entire city was without electricity.
I can't believe everything Tom says.
What are you trying to hide?
The girl is skillful with her fingers.
We have a lot to learn from other cultures.
You're out of luck.
He was a member of the Republican Party.
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
You obviously don't have time.
Someone is knocking on the door.
Have you already completed this task?
I discouraged him from going swimming since it looked like it was going to rain.
He has gone too far.
"How much is he asking for?" "A thousand euros."
Tom needs a prescription.
Do you want him to know about it?
I felt very sleepy.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Do you know how to read a map?
Don't you drag me into this.
Tom couldn't go to the concert because he had to work.
Just do it.
She argued with him about their children's education.
They wake up at six every morning.
He does not like us.
I'm not that drunk.
Because of the dense fog, nothing could be seen.
All of the students have to wear the same uniform.
We'll come to look for you.
I wanted to share it.
I've waited for this too long.
Let's be careful.
He's a real man.
How's your old lady doing?
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
An accident just happened.
I wanted to thank you for what you did today.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
They always go skiing in the winter.
Straighten up.
He wanted to meet me.
How old are you now?
I only need a minute.
What does that even mean?
I want to answer the last question first.
Everyone is waiting on you.
Change was in the air.
I said that I could, not that I would.
That's a possible explanation.
I don't know where to go or what to do.
Did I wake you up?
You go first.
I loved that book.
I want to go to America some day.
They won't help us.
Please stay as long as you wish.
Are you going to help me?
He failed the entrance exam.
Please tell me what you think about this article.
Have you ever lived in Boston?
You've been busy, haven't you?
He wasn't there last week.
They glanced at each other.
I'm not happy about it.
Do you know what it's called?
It's a wonderful work of art.
They got the short end of the stick.
How did you do it?
The police roped off the street near the spot.
I expected him to fail the exam.
What were we supposed to do?
I don't expect anything from you.
I'm the one responsible for the accident.
You've made no allowance for the fact that he is young.
We can't back out now.
I slept all day.
You aren't like the others.
I don't see the point.
I was waiting for a taxi.
My job is dull and boring.
Mind your own business.
Her genius makes up for her lack of experience.
Yesterday I hit on a good idea.
I think she's hiding something.
I'll be back within an hour.
Can I go now?
I think we've wasted enough of your time.
I needed help.
Father is going to undergo an operation.
I don't want it.
That's not quite right.
Admission to the show is by ticket only.
Tom had to leave.
How will I recognize you?
How could you do this to them?
I want him to sing a song.
We will only consent on that condition.
I feel better than ever.
The bus was almost empty.
I didn't study at all.
Who broke the vase?
He accused me of being a liar.
It's really different from what I expected.
The farmer caught the boy stealing the apples in his orchard.
He is not so tall.
This is a farce.
One good friend is better than ten relatives.
I could keep it a secret.
Nothing is more disappointing than to lose in the finals.
This one is ours.
What does he see?
The house has burnt down.
I can't thank you enough for the help you've given me.
The mirror is on top of the dresser.
I'll buy this.
Tom lost his car key.
I'm thin, but not too thin.
I already did that twice today.
Tom took the easy way out.
Are you a cop or something?
I'd like the bill, please.
Tom could've done it by himself.
Where can I find an interpreter?
That movie was amusing.
Not everything is about you.
What are you waiting for?
Who notified you?
Where did I park my car?
You don't understand me, Tom.
He speaks Portuguese.
He lay face up.
Tom never breaks promises.
Please don't take this lightly.
I parked my car by the gate.
Schools are closed for Christmas.
It is rather warm today.
Do you get it?
I came here to save you.
I'd love to know that.
This is a book.
All you have to do is to meet her there.
They shared the money.
Tom knocked on Mary's door.
I stretched out my legs.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
The weather is perfect today.
Can you jump over a chair from a standing position?
You're very good.
It was a pleasant day, but there were few people in the park.
He's three years older than she is.
I think Tom is in love with me.
I can't wait to shower.
No one is invulnerable.
Tom ought to stop smoking.
Have you ever been arrested?
I'm sure you'll do very well.
If I were you, I would paint it blue.
You'll never regret this.
Biting your fingernails is a bad habit.
Call me.
They like to stay informed.
Tom wanted to eat spaghetti.
The audience began to laugh.
I turned off the lamp and went to sleep.
You're very curious.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
I don't understand what you mean.
Don't judge people by their appearance.
I'd like to give Tom something special for his birthday.
Her wishes, it seems, have come true.
We make great money.
Buy the dress you want.
I really need a job.
You will always be welcome.
I hope he's wrong.
I go to work.
He can't have been ill.
They don't want the truth.
I come from Saitama.
She looks happiest when she is with him.
She acted in a play for the first time.
It's time you went to the barber's.
I'm assuming this is your father.
I don't have that kind of money.
She bowed deeply to me.
I don't care for coffee.
I thought I was your best friend.
Tom is the father of three children.
You're not allowed to eat those.
I'd love to go to Boston with you.
He must like taking walks.
I had the strangest dream last night.

Tom and his wife have just had a baby.
Was it you that left the door open last night?
I believe in ghosts.
I'll prove it.
She advised him to go abroad while he was still young.
His work is not up to standard.
She burst into tears.
I don't care about your past.
This is a picture of you.
I will drive you home.
Will they elect him for four more years?
I wish you had come with us.
He was not impressed.
Please refrain from pushing forward.
I don't think she is happy.
Shut up!
I went inside.
I admit there are a few problems.
Are you coming to the party?
I know French.
He studied military history.
Don't tell me to relax.
Do you enjoy talking?
We'll be there.
I wouldn't do that to anybody.
Who's your favorite pianist?
That's not a crime.
It keeps you on your toes.
This is my father's house.
Do you wish to go?
Turn him down once and for all.
Time is of the essence.
I am glad that you have returned safe.
I want a parrot.
They will be safe with me.
She's maxed out all her credit cards.
Tom and Mary are planning a picnic at the lake.
I opened the window.
That's a little unfair.
It's quite safe.
I have enough money to buy it.
Which party do you belong to?
I forgot to tell you something.
He had no money.
I don't care much for coffee.
I'm a little drunk.
We'll be there.
Look up there.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
I love myself.
I wish there were some cute guys in my class.
Could you go to the store and grab some eggs?
He seems very pleasant.
French is a difficult language.
Your composition is the best yet.
The roads were empty.
You should go and have your hair cut.
I want something cold to drink now.
I spent the day with Tom.
I've decided to buy the blue car instead of the red one.
I wonder where Tom is.
Do you want to pray?
I was going to visit a friend.
I can't believe I just shot myself.
The weather is unusual today.
"When do you watch TV?" "I watch TV after dinner."
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I feel like a fool.
Sumo is a traditional Japanese sport.
You don't look very good.
I'll help.
She hates carrots.
That's kind of vague.
Ain't she cute?
Tom walked quickly down the corridor.
He asked me if I was happy.
I'm dissatisfied.
Did you like Boston?
I think you must be tired.
Write with your left hand.
We had no trouble.
Whether rains or not, the game is going to be held.
I'm too tired to argue.
Tom just got dumped.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
I suppose you want to use my office.
Enjoy yourself for a change.
I'm not that fast.
Life begins when you are forty.
I'm tired of eating fast food.
Do you think her story is false?
Let's get out of the rain.
She had to rely upon her inner strength.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Do you understand everything?
Are you a maniac?
Why did you take a cab?
Stay down.
The police are after you.
He took his book.
You are a student.
There was only one left.
Be very careful.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
What have you come here for?
I don't care what you think.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
If you do your best, you're likely to succeed.
We have no hot water because the pipes broke.
This restaurant is badly managed.
If there's anything else you need, just let me know.
You're the best.
Can you briefly sum up what was said at the meeting?
I'm going to give you one more chance.
Tom wants to be strong.
I don't spend much time studying French.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
He lived to a ripe old age.
Why would you want to leave?
There is no doubt in my mind that Tom will win the election.
They can't see me.
I stayed home all day.
There is nothing that can't be bought with money.
I don't think we can really say that one is right and the other is wrong.
Where was he headed?
That's pretty annoying.
What was it that brought you to me?
Why don't you put some clothes on?
Stand up straight.
Come here by ten at the latest.
Wear warm clothes or you could get sick.
He was elected mayor.
He looks suspicious.
I know a boy about your age.
Not every bird can sing.
I know you've been trying to help.
I know what they said.
It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella.
Does that price include tax?
Do not cast pearls before swine.
He lost his ticket for the movie.
I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
Tom said that he'd be late.
This booklet is free of charge.
The sum of all the angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees.
That still leaves us with the question of why.
I like their house.
Honesty is no guarantee of success.
I don't like being surprised.
I'm tired of writing.
Tom couldn't have done it any better.
I have never been there myself.
I didn't need anyone's help.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
Tom seems unable to do that.
The boy got scolded.
I understand your problem.
I found the bed very comfortable.
Do you think this book is worth reading?
I sprang out of bed.
I think I've forgotten something.
I've made that same mistake several times.
Tom earns good money.
You never asked what I wanted.
I want to do this later.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
These are simple sentences.
Do you know anyone in Australia?
That's a really great idea.
I needed money.
They just beat us.
He plays tennis every day.
How much time do you spend shaving every day?
Do you know where he was born?
Are you ready to begin?
I feel safe here.
How would you like us to proceed?
A dog will bark at strangers.
He married a pretty girl.
Who were you talking to?
Staying at home is boring.
All the lights were on.
After the game, he went straight home to feed his dog.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
If you want to sell your old sofa, why not put an advertisement in the local paper?
Tom calls Mary every night.
Do you play the trombone?
That will buy us some time.
I assumed that she was there.
She married him.
Keep writing.
We should have departed earlier.
He has come out of his shell.
You'll be late for work.
I want what you want.
I thought we could talk.
Don't let the cat escape. Close the door!
Please call a taxi for me.
Goodbye till tomorrow.
Local shops do good business with tourists.
Tell me where he is.
I was afraid that might happen.
I feel bad about ruining your party.
It took me a while to understand what she was trying to say.
What are you good at?
I suppose I'd better leave.
My wife's trying to sleep.
She was allowed to go to the disco on condition that she was back by ten.
I'll remember you forever.
They constructed a bridge.
They awarded her a gold metal for her achievement.
They're bad.
You are carrying your joke a bit too far.
I'm armed.
You promised not to be rude to me any more.
You stay here.
He lost his life in a traffic accident.
Let's get out of here before the police come.
She got engaged to him.
I just want you out of my house.
By the time she gets there, it will be nearly dark.
Tom looked through the binoculars.
It has happened before and it will probably happen again.
After a little time off, I plan to go on another concert tour.
Will you please show me the way?
He wrote down all the details.
How do you remove red wine stains from your carpet?
When are you planning to tie the knot?
He has the habit of standing up when he is angry.
Would you go to your room?
A moldy loaf of bread lay on the table.
He has a foreign car.
I love to party.
When did you get there?
Do you really want it?
I like instrumental music.
I had to call off the party.
Tom left the door unlocked.
I plan to never get married.
Be more careful from now on.
I go to any party I am invited to.
Do your homework before you watch TV.
I'm cooking.
He occasionally visited me.
You should be more careful.
I'm not embarrassed.
My life is complete.
I'll start with a beer.
Do you like music?
What's the deal here?
I have nothing to tell you for the moment.
We don't care what he does.
He's afraid to dance.
You're not going fast enough.
I can't keep my eyes off of it.
He is a student at Harvard.
This milk tastes odd.
You know the drill.
If your tooth hurts, you should see a dentist.
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
We're running late.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.
Tom is drowning!
She gave me a pretty doll.
I think you must be getting tired.
We're not through yet.
The job was really tough.
It cannot be helped.
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?
I did do some checking.
I'm not done with you.
I suddenly became dizzy.
I know this song.
It will cool down tonight.
He let me go.
I want to know why you're late.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
Tom was stuck in a traffic jam for what seemed like hours.
I didn't change anything.
Would you mind a little advice?
That's a woman's job.
Stop being cruel.
He broke them.
Tom is a bad coach.
I can speak English.
I just got a raise.
I hear you are good at cooking.
They liked having more space for their children to play.
She's too old for you.
I have a bath every day.
You didn't need to hurry. You got here too early anyway.
Do you consider them dangerous?
What is the delay?
Can you still remember the time we first met?
You're tough.
They called it mass murder.
Come on, try again.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
We can win.
I want to hear everything.
Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking.
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
I wonder if Tom is having fun.
The fat man jumped over the ditch and fell to the ground.
I don't like to go out after dark.
I could answer all the questions.
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
How do you pronounce this?
OK, I'm convinced.
Where do you get off telling me that?
Tom said he regretted not following Mary's advice.
You don't want to be an editor?
I was fascinated by her beauty.
After being in a coma for three weeks, Tom regained consciousness.
I can prove it to you.
She called him every bad name she knew.
Could you turn off the TV?
I'm not in any pain.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
We agreed among ourselves.
The pain still hasn't gone away.
Don't read my journal.
I'd like to know when you plan to give me back the scissors I lent you.
The one who said that is a liar.
I just saw a shooting star.
He said he was hungry, and then he added that he was also thirsty.
Did you buy a new car?
How do I know you didn't do it?
No sailboat is faster than this one.
You can spend the night at our place.
Tom is recovering from his injuries.
I think you might eventually change your mind.
I want ten plates.
The nurse tied a rubber tube around my arm before he drew blood.
We're not going to make it.
I really appreciate your coming.
I'm thinking about you.
I don't think it works that way.
I'll be watching you.
You're silly.
I said there's no one here.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
Did you see Tom at school today?
If you were able to go camping with us, I think we'd all have fun.
We caught you.
You should not judge a person by his clothes.
Tom was a great guy.
He asked some questions of the lady standing next to him.
If God had meant for us to be naked, we'd have been born that way.
I would sooner die than give up.
Did you have fun last night?
It tastes just right.
There were no problems.
Did you just hear what you said?
Please be polite.
I can't believe we've never done this before.
She wants to marry a millionaire.
I don't have the results.
She assured him that everything was OK.
He's busy and can't meet with you.
She kissed me, not him.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
You worry too much about Tom.
It is a pity you cannot come.
Why don't you take your coat off?
The more time I spend doing this, the less time I have to do things I enjoy doing.
She accused me of making a mistake.
Give credit where credit is due.
Tom died a few months later.
I had to do everything alone.
We're stuffed.
What do you need to know?
There've been times when that's happened.
I feel useless.
I'm really busy.
British English differs from American English in many ways.
I never told you to quit.
He arrived in time.
I don't know what's happening.
I think it will be hot today.
He will make a good team captain.
She didn't want him to die.
It looks very nice.
I'm sneaky.
It's a double-edged sword.
She fell from the tree.
I was born in 1972.
This is temporary.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
You ought not to make fun of them.
English and German are two related languages.
He speaks ten languages.
I think it won't rain tomorrow.
This is Japan.
Her complaints never cease.
Are you meeting someone here?
Plutonium-244 has a half-life of 80 million years.
I got lost and had a hard time finding my way back to the hotel.
That really scares me.
Is that all you wanted to tell us?
He's working on it.
I'm an American citizen.
I feel like a rest.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
I can't express my feelings.
Shortly after the accident, the police came.
I'd like to get together with you tonight.
It has been raining since Tuesday.
She took him for all his money.
I could help.
I actually have to run.
I don't need your help anymore.
Cats can climb trees, but dogs can't.
Keep trying.
How did things turn out?
We don't have a pool.
London, the capital of England, is on the Thames.
He went on doing it.
I want to go to Seattle.
What a nightmare!
Do you deny it?
Just as I was about to go out, it started raining.
Tom is voting.
Why did you open the box?
I wonder if we can get in.
It would be sad if that were true.
I didn't really care about that.
Tom doesn't think this is such a good idea.
I've been shopping all day.
How did I let this happen?
No one believed his story.
I used to have one, but it was stolen.
They were very excited.
It looks like we might have good weather today.
I had to make a decision.
I get dizzy when I stand up.
He asked for the money.
A good book is the best of friends, the same today and forever.
This is the person I talked about the other day.
Tom's plan seemed the best.
I hesitated about which road to take.
We don't need you.
I haven't told anyone else.
My neighbor's son made fun of my daughter today at school.
She absolutely trounces me whenever we play Scrabble.
No students went there yesterday.
I was not pleased.
We can't do this without you.
Can we do this another time?
Going to Boston was Tom's lifelong dream.
I'm tough.
I don't know if it's what he wants or not.
Can you remember anything?
Why don't you look it up in the phone book?
I like my life.
We got married on October 20, 2013.
Don't tell anyone.
You should put your ideas in writing.
Do turtles have teeth?
His office is on the eighth floor.
Everyone jumped into the pool.
Everything is better without you.
Are you a cop?
I don't believe anything you say anymore.
Tom spends his mornings in the garden.
I was called on in English class.
She spread a beautiful cloth on a table.
I'm happy, too.
They wanted protection.
Tom seems angry.
I came to give you this.
My father spends a lot of time on his hobby.
I'm no fool.
What're you talking about?
I don't play any instrument.
Tom changes his passwords often.
Things did not go as intended.
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come.
I'll never leave you alone again.
I didn't tell anyone about it.
A swarm of hornets attacked the children.
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
You should study harder.
I speak French and English.
The money is at your disposal.
Did I tell you that?
I make it a rule to take a walk every morning.
Tom might've fooled you, but he won't fool me.
Where did you hide it?
You must respect senior citizens.
Tom was right after all.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
It's all Greek to me.
We want revenge.
I tried to save you.
You'll never escape that way.
Keep your gun handy.
I never said that it wasn't a good idea.
Why aren't you taking notes?
Has the movie started yet?
He was strict in disciplining his children.
I want to know the reason.
Be careful not to drive on the wrong side of the road.
I don't want to miss the bus.
I need to get my oboe repaired.
That's a pretty dress you have on.
Do you have a phone?
I'm sure I turned off the gas.
Tom's helping.
One is new, and the other is old.
Where's the boss?
I don't quite know how it happened.
Things can change.
They stopped doing that.
Before you can love others, you need to be able to love yourself.
Are you envious?
He's still at work.
That may not be necessary.
If you're not happy, quit.
You're not safe here.
I'm not a monster.
Is it my turn?
She is afraid of barking dogs.
I'm a slow learner.
A good book is a great companion.
Please have my baggage brought to the station.
Sometimes, you must fail before you succeed.
She needs some help from us.
He has a dog and six cats.
He tried to solve the problem, but had no luck.
I have neither time nor money for that.
Are you feeling better now?
It was a revelation to me.
Rabbits are extremely social animals.
He finds pleasure in watching people.
Tom does love you.
He's three years older than her.
I sell computers.
She had gone to bed.
This isn't a safe place.
I wish that I could give you the money you need.
This shop is a rental video shop.
Can you say that again?
"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
I nearly choked on a fishbone.
He's the class clown.
The water is deepest here.
Tom warned me it would be smoky here.
I wrote a letter in English.
I could hear doors slamming.
I should have talked to you first about it.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
She was banished for life.
This is your final warning.
They missed the train.
It's dirty work.
You are free to do as you please with your money.
This is a private matter.
I do not feel sad.
We've already talked about that.
I promise I'll call.
I left my wife.
I'll take some X-rays of your teeth.
My sister is a teacher.
I only drink water.
I was not pleased.
We all have fun.
We're under attack.
The streets were covered with snow.
Are you afraid of that?
I think you have my umbrella.
You can tell me the truth.
I can't be seen with you.
Do you feel any better today?
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
You don't understand women, Tom.
How did it feel?
How long did you stay at the party?
I can't stop procrastinating.
I'm going to America this summer.
He waited his turn.
Everyone except me was invited.
The rumor's all over town.
I don't like it when he does that.
I love this one.
This airplane is capable of carrying 40 passengers at a time.
You're the one who trained me.
How do you put up with it?
That shouldn't be too hard to do.
I have more dresses than my sister.
It is strange that you should know nothing about the matter.
He will excuse me.
This is true love.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my mother.
I don't feel much like laughing.
Can you read that?
I'll do everything for you.
I have been in Japan for three years.
Spain was ruled by a dictator until 1975.
He is very learned.
Please help me take this down.
Did he show you the picture?
It's only temporary.
I don't deserve to be so happy.
That man has a bad reputation.
Unfortunately, the report is true.
I'm engaged.
I can't forget about that stupid movie.
I've been very busy lately.
He did not die of cancer.
Let me out!
That mountain is five times as high as this one.
I come from Brazil.
I'm dying for a cold drink.
I think I know where Tom is.
It's awful.
I'm going to make some coffee. Would you like some, too?
You always were good at math.
Fill the bucket with water.
May I go first?
Who made the actual arrest?
We drank all night.
Stop what you're doing.
Nobody had anything else to say.
I don't understand music.
The hotel is run by his uncle.
He was lucky.
She was born at six a.m. on July 17.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
She tried to conceal the fact.
Nowadays, almost every home has one or two televisions.
I'm very excited and happy.
Do you have a crush on my brother?
You know Tom better than anybody.
I cut up all but one of my credit cards.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
It was the happiest time of my life.
Am I wasting my time?
Can you get the door to shut?
Tom is afraid.
Can you persuade him to join our club?
She wrote to him to tell him that she couldn't come to visit next summer.
How do you prefer your eggs?
The lock on my drawer had been tampered with and some of my papers were missing.
Do you want kids?
You could be one of them.
Don't you know who that is?
We are short of money.
Tom has been teaching me how to play the guitar.
Don't disappoint me the way you did the other day.
Can you play the piano?
Don't you recognize that guy?
I'd like to visit Australia.
She ignores him completely.
I don't take orders from you.
The bus should be here by now.
I want them all shot.
We're looking for a friend of ours.
He is full of ambition.
He comes to see me nearly every day.
Give me an example.
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
I appreciate that very much.
I would like to visit New York someday.
She advised him to see the dentist.
He did it out of kindness.
It feels good to be back.
I had him write it.
Tom is a black belt in karate.
I don't care who you're going with.
He's not sick.
Bigger doesn't always mean better.
You can't eat chicken? How do you know if you never try it?
Nobody else has a chance.
It hasn't happened yet.
Neither is true.
No one in his class can run faster than he does.
Would you like to go dancing?
He has access to the American Embassy.
I'll take your coat.
You've seen enough.
May I eat another piece of cake?
We're getting nowhere.

Her uncle is a famous doctor.
Did he show you the picture?

I want to stay here a couple more days.

I am very hungry.
I like dogs very much.
Could you give me a leg up here?
At our high school, French is an elective.
You're the only one who understands me.
She doesn't know how to ride a bike.
Has Tom calmed down?
He wiped his nose on his sleeve.
In English the verb precedes the object.
You should not keep people waiting.
Mary isn't Tom's wife.
Tom taught Mary to read.
Why are you so tired today?
Your composition is the best yet.
No one can tell.
I found it in the attic.
She traveled around the world.
I just want to take a quick look.
He is not going to get ahead.
They had no money left.
Please don't forget to mail this letter.
Fill this out, please.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
Tom won't talk to me about it.
Do you remember when you last saw Tom?
I'll pick you up at your home at five.
Three of the hostages have been released.
That's not the issue.
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
Everybody's life is complicated.
I fully support your proposal.
He is digging his own grave.
I wanted to see you, too.
You said you were going to handle it.
I'm not sure why.
Try to rest.
I really am glad you're here.
I didn't see anything.
There was no toilet paper.
My mom taught me how to do it.
Tom has charisma.
Let me out!
She knows everything about cooking.
Will you give it to me?
I freaked out.
I caught a fish!

Your theory has no scientific basis.
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.
He is working in the field of biology.
His sister looks young.
Are you from around here?
This is the tallest tower in Japan.
I almost forgot to tell Tom about the party.
Park the car in the shade.
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
I'm really happy.
Can you spare a buck?
You've got to be bold!
She did her best to rescue him.
Am I being unreasonable?
Let me talk.
I want a knife to cut the rope with.
We're better than they are.
Did he go there?
Your guess is almost right.
Get down.
An actor has to memorize his lines.
Don't believe him.
He stayed there some time.
Why does she look so sad?
You saved us all.
People who ignore history tend to repeat it.
I think Tom needs your help.
As far as I know, he is an honest man.
He urged his government not to sign it.
I saw the file.
Did you have fun?
Tom is very easy to work with.
My cholesterol levels are high.
Compare the two carefully, and you will see the difference.
Tom is driving without a license.
Now it's time for the weather forecast.
They don't take care of that dog.
Defend yourself.
Where did the money go?
Both of them seem suspicious.
He was getting old.
Can you repair this?
I hate traveling.
This book costs 3,000 yen.
We grew up together.
There's no way to win.
They water the fruit trees.
I was watching TV then.
What keeps you awake at night?
I want you out of here now.
What color is Mary's scarf?
On the American flag, there's a star for every state.
Your father seems very nice.
Tom decided to give up.
We lived close by the sea.
He took off his clothes.
I doubt Tom really needs to do that.
He puts on airs.
Now is the time for action.
A new building is being built in front of my house.
I'll see you a week from today.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
The ambassador returned.
It is dangerous to ride a motorbike without a helmet.
I couldn't hear what was being said.
I think that we should stop doing that.
You look very pale.
The clouds are coming from the south.
Put some salt on your meat.
I must continue.
Would you like to be my apprentice?
We are anxious about our daughter's health.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
We're just tired.
Pull the rope tight.
Autumn is here.
I have to know now.
He'll be seventeen in February.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
I need you to do me a favor.
The ice is too hard to crack.
I ask your forgiveness.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
Volunteers are cleaning up the park today.
No one can deny the fact that fire burns.
Get in the van.
The CIA is watching you.
He wants to go out with her.
It never occurred to me that what I was doing might be illegal.
Are you out of your minds?
I got married 8 years ago.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
I don't like who you've become.
Aren't you going to open the box?
I'm sure there's another way out.
You're right, of course.
My watch is five minutes slow.
You're forgiven.
I like short poems.
Of all the possible reasons, he chose the least expected one.
Make yourself at home.
It is difficult to understand this novel.
You were telling the truth, weren't you?
You don't want to know.
You should have kept your mouth shut.
I'll try to find one.
When will he be freed?
I don't want you to see me naked.
He married a Canadian girl.
I have one.
Don't interfere with him if you want him to like you.
They made me go there.
Have you been listening to me?
Do you have difficulty losing weight?
It's even worse than I thought.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Someone has cut my kite string.
Really?
They had once helped each other.
Do you have something to say?
I hate losing.
Mario is an Italian citizen.
He's been dead ten years.
Tom says he needs to talk with you.
I just can't get it right.
You came at just the right time.
She is a college student.
Here I come.
When do you plan to start?
Tom and Mary are getting married in October.
Sit beside me.
What could possibly go wrong?
I can't believe I'm here again.
Children want to hear the same story over and over again.
We're getting a new car next month.
How could you know?
You look Japanese.
We are brother and sister.
I missed the two o'clock plane.
Are you going on foot or by bus?
The room is crawling with spiders.
I'll wait for you in the lobby.
I guess you'll need some help.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
Our little girl is growing up.
That was one of the biggest mistakes in my life.
She'll be just fine.
You should be more careful.
He told me that he would start the next day.
I live in this hotel.
He lives apart from his family.
How do you intend to do it?
I didn't say I wasn't going.
Join us.
How many students are there in your class?
We're not gonna make it.
Have you seen my coat?
It was never like that.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
I don't want to participate in the ceremony.
I feel a little responsible.
Where is the nearest police station?
I can't do this again.
I found the book by accident.
Please let me know what you want.
Why are you sleeping?
This is irregular.
The jury found the man guilty of murder.
I sold it for ten dollars.
They had had to use what money they had.
They said they would not fight.
It's right next door.
I think you should get started.
You've got to be bold!
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
I'm stuffed.
You need to be careful.
What were you doing then?
Can you see Tom?
What've you been doing today?
They didn't swim because it was cold.
Fruit tends to rot right away.
Will it fit?
Be watchful.
I'm involved.
I put some cream in my coffee.
Tom knew how to talk to women.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I feel like such an idiot.
I can't do this by myself.
Please copy this.
Who are you talking about?
I mistook him for my brother.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
Why don't you just ask your parents for money?
He liked that.
Do not do that.
I'll give you back the money tomorrow.
All of the students were present.
It is very hot in the summer in Japan.
There is no table in the room.
He flinches whenever he hears a loud, sudden noise.
I know what they'll want me to do.
Turn left at the second traffic light.
What exactly do you want us to do?
It seemed likely.
Does your school have a library?
He had a kind word and a pleasant smile for everyone.
Does this ring a bell?
They should be fine.
You told us she was kind and she really is.
He is the head of marketing.
I'm sure you will succeed.
I want you to look out the window.
You're so wrong.
She made her mother happy.
Have you asked if they want one?
He was making a speech, but he abruptly stopped speaking when he heard a strange noise.
Do you have anything non-alcoholic?
Is there anything I can do for you?
This old coat has had it.
He is writing a novel.
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
I am looking forward to seeing you next Sunday.
I want to talk with your uncle.
Smell this.
I guarantee it.
I think you mentioned that last week.
He felt very lonely.
The concert was successful.
You'll sleep better tonight.
I said it might rain.
Let's not get carried away here.
I'm getting married in October.
I remember this word.
She looked very beautiful in her new dress.
I was shocked to see it.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
I don't know who you are.
I want to thank you.
Can you take us with you?
Which car is your father's?
I let the cat out of the house.
What time did you close the store last night?
That's idle talk.
Father has gone fishing.
I ate lunch in a hurry.
This cat is Tom's.
Can I carry this on the plane?
For all his wealth, he is unhappy.
Tom is a spy.
I don't know anybody in Boston.
Finish your drink.
I am pretty sure.
He cleaned it up.
Your friends are late.
I didn't steal it.
Juggling is another thing I'm not very good at.
Was her story true?
She tempted him.
I like you.
I'm willing to accept your offer.
Let's check that shop, too.
The first time is always the hardest.
I need your advice.
I received this electric knife as a gift.
Show me everything.
We're hoping to open in October.
She rented a four-room apartment.
She gave it her personal attention.
I felt isolated.
I thought you were my friend.
Let's hurry up.
If it were not for his idleness, he would be a nice fellow.
I plead ignorance.
He was voted prom king.
I love cooking.
When will we arrive in Tokyo?
I appreciate your efforts to help me.
This is pointless.
They were all dressed in uniforms.
Tom is still at his grandfather's house.
I can't wait forever.
Don't worry. We're safe here.
Are you going or not?
We don't need that stuff.
Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
I'm way stronger than I used to be.
Don't you think it's time you left?
What do you think happened to Tom?
Why would you want to do that?
I made some mistakes on the test.
Turn the hose off.
When I got home, I had a nice, ice-cold shower.
You probably just want to be alone.
You are important.
Father recovered his health.
Do I really have to go to bed?
Tom won't visit Boston.
There is no school during August.
She handed him the money.
I think he likes me.
I know this will work.
We'll always be together.
That boy showed no fear.
I don't need your help.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
We didn't recognize each other.
Of the eight, only one was found guilty.
They huddled together.
That's all you get.
I want to go to school in Australia.
He wants to marry my daughter.
This is rubbish.
I refuse to give up on this.
Let's talk about Tom and what he's done.
Do you want me to tell Tom?
Tom often cries when he's drunk.
It's phony.
His salary is double what it was seven years ago.
Do you understand what I am saying?
Go and see who it is.
I don't want to get married.
I don't care much for coffee.
How did you learn Esperanto?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
He's now aboard the ship.
Whose car is this?
I'm coming right home.
I bought an electric car.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I feel blessed.
I can't afford to buy another computer.
See what happens when you tell the truth?
She lived there about five years.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
You're really annoying.
What did you eat for lunch today?
I'll be inside.
There are a lot of places to see around here.
Where did you meet your girlfriend?
Tom left his briefcase on the subway.
I wasn't able to believe him at first.
He went for a swim in the lake every morning.
Smoking is permitted.
If I had my way, you would all be fired.
It all seems so strange.
We're not listening.
The city was bombed by enemy planes.
I showed her my room.
He still hasn't responded to my letter.
I read a lot of books last summer.
Get us out of here.
Tom and I work at the same hospital.
This intersection is dangerous.
What's that your wearing?
The street in front of my house is pretty narrow.
I've got news for you, Tom.
What has made you decide to work for our company?
That isn't what I'm looking for.
I can't get rid of this cold.
Can I get an advance on my salary?
You should try to be more like Tom.
It's better to give than to receive.
As a boy, he would go to the seaside every summer.
A new school building is under construction.
Could you keep your eye out for my car keys?
They're dead.
I got out of the taxi.
He entered his room.
We're not cops.
You're wonderful.
Wonderful!
I tried to protect you.
White is a popular car color.
I'll take in the washing before it rains.
I figured you might change your mind.
Hopefully, Tom won't be as crazy as the rest of his family when he grows up.
You make me laugh a lot.
I know you're busy, too.
God bless you!
It is no use trying again.
Tom doesn't know whether to turn left or right.
I don't need to be here right now.
This is my umbrella.
My sister takes a shower every morning.
I am on good terms with my brother.
You must be strong.
How much money do you have on you right now?
Do you have a larger size?
I listened to her story.
My roommate complained about the noise.
Tom sounds exhausted.
That company produces microchips.
She was disappointed with the result.
His older sister is older than my oldest brother.
Thanks for your quick answer.
I have a new girlfriend.
I know where they're taking Tom.
You're taller than me.
Use this as a model.
He gave up hope.
She helped cook lunch.
I think I'll go skiing.
I'd love to go with you to the show, but I'm flat broke.
This has to be a mistake.
They told me it was your fault.
I got up while it was still dark.
Don't mock me.
I'm dependable.
You will save your father a lot of worry if you simply write him a letter.
My favorite fish is salmon.
We can't attend.
As far as I know, this is the latest edition.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
My sister often looks after the baby.
He ran at full speed.
The lovers fell into each other's arms every chance they got.
I do not like mathematics very much.
It may rain tonight.
The water is pure.
Never tell me a lie again.
He is suffering from toothache.
He will advise you on that matter.
I'm sorry to interrupt you while you're talking.
You're very clever.
I'll give you this money.
Roll down the window.
Tom assigned Mary to do the job.
Aren't you convinced?
I only have butter in my refrigerator.
The meeting is held twice a month.
What do you say we go there?
That's how it started.
Let's take a walk for a change.
I had things to do, so I couldn't leave right away.
Come on, grow up.
Tell me you're kidding.
Those two are exactly alike.
I painted the roof light blue.
He is said to have died here.
You're too polite.
Is anybody ready for dessert?
If you're not happy, quit.
That's all I wanted to know.
You're assertive.
He will defeat them.
She lived a happy life.
Were you born there?
He put up a notice about the change in price.
You're unbelievably stupid.
It's just a fad.
Who allowed him in?
Will you sing some English songs for us?
You're disappointed, aren't you?
Now I realise why she was angry with me.
She unbuttoned her shirt.
I don't have enough.
His sleeve touched the greasy pan.
Call me at the office.
I never stopped loving you.
Do you know the answer?
I caught him cheating on the exam.
What if the unthinkable should happen?
All you have to do is to concentrate.
Can I get a connecting flight to Atlanta?
She couldn't convince him to go home.
Wake me up at eight.
Do you really want to do this?
He was the only one not invited to the party.
The noise gets on my nerves.
You are hilarious.
I must insist.
I can't help laughing at him.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
Tom asked Mary for something to drink.
I want you all to know that I'll never change.
No matter what happens, just keep smiling.
This letter was never meant to be sent.
He always plans a thing out carefully before he does it.
I was lying on my back.
I'd like to be a guitarist.
I sure hope he passes the test.
Is that your real name?
As soon as she got her salary, she spent it all.
The child painted flowers.
It's not supposed to happen.
I thought we had a good time.
Ask anyone.
I don't mind if you smoke.
I won't forget.
It was a judgment call.
What's that stuff?
I was kind of expecting that to happen.
He is satisfied with the result.
I need it right away.
She was poor, but she was honest.
My cell phone has a built-in digital camera.
That's all it takes.
I think you did great.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
I have an appointment at 2:30.
I've finished watering the flowers.
God created man in his own image.
This is my dog.
She refuses to say more about it.
You're the only one who understands me.
This fruit doesn't taste good.
Tom thought Mary could speak French.
Rice grows in warm climates.
He is the boss's private secretary.
You read too much.
Remove your hat.
I was invited to dinner.
He instantly fell in love with her.
I saw a town in the distance.
I guess you think you're pretty special, don't you?
Stop hitting me!
Who else is out there?
One of you two is going to have to go there.
He is sure of success.
Actually, we've already met.
Were you looking at him?
I just don't want to talk to you.
Everybody panicked.
You didn't get very far.
Why did you side with him instead of me?
I'm tired of all your fussing.
I'll treat you.
You can use my dictionary.
I'm a genius.
Don't make a sound.
The teacher has given Tom permission to do whatever he wants.
It's not going to be easy to finish this job on time.
They fought until the end.
She's loved by her friends.
What was your favorite part?
I caused this.
I don't know where Tom is.
He can't afford a new car.
We're about the same age.
Everybody is very busy.
I feel like dancing.
I refuse to be taken in by her guile.
We're all hungry.
I'm not done with you yet.
Some factories pollute the environment.
You're probably tired.
Your answer is far from satisfactory.
I can now die a happy man.
I can't understand why you are so critical of him.
When did all this happen?
You're very astute.
You should rewrite this sentence.
Did they live here?
Don't you want to know?
You always want to control everything.
It is extremely hot and humid in Bali in December.
There was nothing I could do about it.
If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
You're arrogant.
What position do you hold?
Foreign direct investments in China amounted to $3 billion last year.
He needs to speak English.
It's the highest building in this city.
That's a very bad idea.
I don't have to go right away.
Is Tom always like this?
Why did you come here?
Let Tom do his job.
I will go and take a look at the house.
He let me go.
I don't need a suitcase that big.
The doctor pronounced him dead.
My father likes strong coffee.
He touched me.
I don't need to write it down.
I'll allow you to go.
You're late.
I want you to grow up.
No students were absent.
She helped the old man across the street.
We all need to learn to deal with this situation.
What do we call you?
It is inconceivable to me that he would do such a thing.
I must confess that my theory doesn't account for that fact.
Out of my way!
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
Do you have any small change?
He left the book on the table.
I gave up all hope of survival.
Open the bottle.
I wonder if he'll come tonight.
Will you dance with me?
Don't take this the wrong way.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
Could I use the phone?
I wasn't hired.
She is distantly related to him.
I don't have as much experience as you.
She was busy with household work.
Call a doctor immediately.
He left after me.
You are a student.
You only have to ask for it.
I'm giving you one more chance.
Do you think Tom will like the concert?
Have you ever been married?
They gave up.
I want to help you figure this out.
She was humiliated by him.
I haven't eaten for days.
I can't help doubting his honesty.
By then, however, it was too late.
I will always be with you.
We bought a round table.
I'd like to get started right away.
I don't like this jacket.
The situation became worse by the minute.
I don't even want to know who you are.
I've been following you.
This is what I was looking for.
I don't hear any voices.
Didn't you go out?
I studied French for three hours last night.
This isn't a game.
We know this song.
I'll be watching you.
Get into your car.
I wrote that book.
Who's in control?
I used to be your age.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
A stranger came into the building.
Tom didn't have time to read the report.
Even though I looked for it, I did not find it.
I want to buy a dozen eggs.
These plums are ripe.
I have never been to that town.
I refused at first.
I love your sweater.
I'm not good at public speaking.
That better not be Tom.
I'd rather do this without your help.
She kindly gave me a ride home.
My house is up the road.
That's something I've always wanted.
A friend of mine came to see me during the day.
Shall I come to your office?
That makes everything simpler.
My mother knows how to make cakes.
I was in a great mood.
You're big.
We arrived at the airport three hours before our flight.
Tom is outside watering the flowers.
What'll grow in this soil?
It's against my religion.
Show me your hands.
He jumped from one subject to another.
Tom spends too much time on the computer.
When you see Tom, tell him I said hello.
Don't take it so literally.
I've had enough.
The property was divided equally among the heirs.
I want to personally thank you.
Would you like another glass of wine?
Why did he live in the United States?
That was not an earthquake.
I want you to kiss me.
She quit her job last month.
She asked him why he was crying.
I don't want you to worry about me.
He pretended not to know me.
Tom is a trumpet player.
I've already done the hard part.
Tom burst out laughing.
I want to know what you're doing here.
He made her cry.
Just do your job.
We couldn't do that.
It's old and clunky.
I loved that car.
I was home for a couple of days.
I want to stay in a hotel near the airport.
They prefer the shadows rather than the spotlight.
Tom lost the race.
Hurry up, or you'll miss your plane.
This is not about money.
Where did you go yesterday?
Why did you stop?
I feel very guilty.
She's innocent.
My sister is engaged in social work.
There has been a rash of burglaries in my neighborhood.
That sound is annoying.
I must leave now.
Tom looked disoriented.
You're very brave.
I like Tom's personality.
Hurry! Tom says it's urgent.
You are a good cook, aren't you?
Can you swim?
It is time for me to take a vacation.
The train is always on time.
I told Tom he made a mistake.
No one was there.
I'm impressed you've done so well.
It's new.
She gave us lots to eat.
Tom doesn't want to eat lunch now.
A permanent costs extra.
She's really smart, isn't she?
After eating supper, I washed the dishes.
I'm stuck here.
Tom emigrated to Australia in 2013.
I know this is difficult for you.
Do you want to cancel the meeting?
Did you show it to your parents?
Most Hollywood movies have happy endings
I would like to order a sandwich.
Why didn't the police notify us?
We should write a formal letter to the director.
You must be very proud of your son.
Do you want some water?
Above all, don't forget to write me.
We're prepared to make tough choices.
This milk will keep for two days.
I'll be with you as soon as I finish this job.
Are you busy now?
Please don't go away.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Do you have any pets?
My brother is stupid.
What makes you think Tom can do this?
My brother went to the United States to study law.
Tom didn't even want to eat.
Tom took Mary's money.
I was there the other day.
Tom saw a mouse.
That's a trivial error.
Go ahead, try it now.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
The people I work with are all very kind.
Get me something to eat.
I got lost in the snow.
They have already finished the work.
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
Tom saw Mary leave.
Promise me that you'll help Tom.
I have nothing to declare.
Do you have the time?
Tom peeked inside.
A slip of the tongue is sometimes fatal to a politician.
I can't afford the time to travel.
Tom lacks confidence in himself.
I do not watch television.
Let's try to solve the riddle.
Tom is a bit short for his age.
Grab that.
Will you join us?
No matter how hard the training was, she never cried.
I haven't finished all my homework yet.
She looked him right in the eye.
The rumor proved to be true.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
There's a serious problem.
He was very tall, so I recognized him at once.
Do you have anything to say in particular?
I'd forgotten that.
I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.
What you were taught is wrong.
I'm going crazy.
A ship that transports oil is called an oil tanker.
My father brags about never having had a traffic accident.
How dare you speak like that?
I've never been so proud.
Do you mind if I sit?
Tom and Mary decided to leave.
It isn't as cold here as in Alaska.
I thought so.
I'd like to be a veterinarian.
This is a lion.
It's even worse than I thought.
He offered more than could be expected.
I didn't stop.
I waited more than two hours.
I know the feeling.
Do you have change for a dollar?
Tom wants me to stay away from him.
The protesters set many cars on fire.
My mother prepared me for the bad news.
I expected you home an hour ago.
He is sick.
I'm ashamed that I did that.
It's starting to snow.
He moved the desk to the right.
How long did it take you to write this report?
I'm busy, too.
I think we should go.
Do you need the keys?
They showed it to our company.
I made breakfast.
The withdrawal symptoms are more severe than I thought.
He's a goal keeper.
Don't you recognize that guy?
He can swim on his back.
He loves taking trips.
Can I talk to you a sec?
She bears an uncanny resemblance to Marilyn Monroe.
What kind of work will you do?
The scarecrow in the backyard fell over during the hurricane.
I have a lot of love for you.
She teaches us French.
What do you usually eat for lunch?
When you get to be my age, you'll understand what I mean.
His opinion was not accepted.
Graham Greene is a favorite author of mine.
A bottle of shampoo costs as much as a tube of toothpaste.
Only time will tell you if you're right.
He will be a good teacher.
What exactly don't you get?
I want to be a magician.
I'll buy you a drink.
I have to study French.
Tom didn't tell Mary he couldn't speak French.
Of the 23 who were arrested, four escaped.
I was scolded by my teacher.
I have lost my friends.
My dog is wagging his tail.
I feel dizzy every time I get up.
I would like to check yesterday's stock prices...
How did you manage to do that?
You're annoying me.
You just don't get it, do you?
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
What year were you born?
Don't you have any will power?
Tom has back problems.
I think you need help.
Are you in any of those pictures?
You only live once.
Tom's French is actually not very good.
This job pays pretty well.
He has a nose bleed.
My motorcycle broke down on the way.
Does the medicine act quickly?
Her dream is to visit Paris.
Does that seem fair to you?
I had only one drink.
What age was she when she first drove a car?
I'm your best friend.
Do you have any pets?
All the tickets are sold out.
I took a nap.
Let me hear from you very soon.
You know the law.
You're the laziest person I know.
Would you mind turning down the radio?
I'm sure you're going to like this.
I love you both.
They were perfect.
I got up at 4:00, ate some food, then went back to sleep.
What is your name?
I saw a flock of sheep.
He doesn't seem to care.
Can you speak a little louder, please?
I was not conscious of her presence.
Have you read this article?
The smell of macaroni and cheese makes me nauseous.
When do you practice the piano?
I want you to put in a good word for me.
The river flooded the entire region.
What period is this painting from?
I had no doubts.
Tom is our best player.
Could you reduce the price a little?
Tom leaned on the counter.
I don't need to go to college.
Science is very exciting.
Most people can't tell the difference.
It is too hot to work.
I'm trying to talk to you.
I'll see you there.
I can see it in your eyes.
She introduced me to her sister.
Tom is now in jail.
The homework is due next week.
Don't point your finger at me.
They left very early in the morning.
He was assigned a task.
Tom took more than one picture, didn't he?
I was amazed at his courage.
Do you really think it's bad?
He became a famous singer.
I'd been on my own all week and was starving for conversation.
You don't sound convinced.
How do you stand this cold?
We cannot rule out the possibility that civil war will break out in that country.
Is this a compliment?
I'd never hire Tom.
You have lipstick on your cheek.
Her composition is very good except for a few errors in spelling.
She is knitting a sweater.
What is the tallest mountain in Europe?
I thought hard.
I like dark chocolate.
It feels silly.
Tom has the necessary experience.
He left without so much as saying goodbye.
This should be fun.
He ordered me to go alone.
Could I use your desk?
You can't go outside.
Please come in.
This is a book of children's stories.
I'm sorry, we don't accept checks.
Don't be so shy.
You dropped something.
We have enough time.
I have no one to help me.
I must renew my passport.
I can't lift boxes over thirty kilograms.
Tom said that he liked me.
I found the secret compartment quite by accident.
Come and see me.
Tom has been patiently waiting all morning.
Do you have an airplane ticket back home?
I'd study harder if I were you.
Tom will thank me for this one of these days.
It is no use asking him again.
Why did you say such a thing?
I would consider Boston a very big city.
I didn't cheat.
I'm right, aren't I?
Sometimes I wonder whether or not I made the right decision.
I left as soon as I could.
Either you or I have to go there.
Your father's supporters are not limited to his friends.
I found a rare book I had been looking for.
Tom already knows the truth.
They made fun of my clothes.
How in the world did you find me?
Aren't you dressed yet?
There's a long line at every cash register.
Can you account for all the money you spent?
I found this book by chance in a secondhand bookstore.
We saw her when leaving the house.
I'd like to rent a car.
I'll never leave you alone again.
Will you still be here this afternoon?
You're not allowed to eat those.
Malaria is a disease that mosquitoes carry.
Drop the gun.
We went swimming at the beach.
She told him that her father had died.
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
I'm not frightened of anything.
I am seeing Mary this afternoon.
I guess I've gotten lazy.
I didn't expect that to come from you.
I don't like coffee.
You seem depressed.
His mother used to be a singer.
Are you that stupid?
What happened at that intersection?
You should have been more careful with your health.
The girl doesn't like to play soccer.
Take your elbows off the table.
How long has it been since you gave up teaching at that school?
I feel quite at ease among strangers.
My hobby is shopping.
I am surprised that your family has a Japanese car.
Tom has been growing a beard all summer.
You're nuts!
May I ask you to do me a favor?
If you push the button, the engine will stop.
How did you learn to do that?
My whole family is doing well.
I don't understand anything.
I'll stay here until ten.
This doesn't involve you.
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
We hope this never happens again.
I'd buy that.
It was just a coincidence.
He has already finished his work.
What did it look like?
I don't understand why it happened.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.
I've had a very busy morning.
Mother decided otherwise.
Where would you like to go?
Sit near here.
I dislike coffee.
We have a long trip ahead of us.
What does Tom eat for breakfast?
I watch television after supper.
Prices went up.
Don't be too sensitive to criticism.
Where's convenient for you?
What nonsense are you talking now?
Better to die on our feet, than to live on our knees.
I'd never let that happen.
You don't smoke, do you?
I can't help feeling something's wrong.
Have you ever seen the man in this photo?
I think you look great.
I attended his funeral.
He can also speak a little Greek.
He became rich through hard work.
Even wounds that have healed, leave scars behind.
Why do you always do this?
We all had a good time.
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
That no longer matters.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lived across the street from him.
I don't have the ball.
I want to know where Tom went.
It is time you told her the truth.
Your wife is going to ask you for a divorce.
I'm failing at my job.
I feel better already.
Thanks for calling, Tom.
I am so sorry.
I decided to come to Japan last year.
I had to stop.
Buses in the country don't usually come on time.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
That's what's worrying me.
He placed emphasis on the importance of education.
I can't deal with you anymore.
There is a little water left.
I smell blood.
Were you obedient?
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
The vast majority of children love ice cream.
What are you trying to prove?
I never thought I would find a woman like you.
I drink tea without sugar.
In all probability, we'll arrive before them.
He passed the entrance examination.
May I use the toilet?
You have no life.
You shouldn't do such a thing.
Tom is on his way back to Boston.
Everyone fell asleep.
She's busy now and can't talk with you.
They both snickered.
I can't stand this pain any more.
I'm going back home tomorrow.
Let's get together on Sunday.
I can help you look for it.
I want to get out of here.
Can you believe this is already happening?
I hated school.
Do you think I'm to blame?
I'll do my very best not to disappoint you.
You're faithful.
This is the last straw.
He repaired his watch by himself.
Did you drop it?
Fasten your seatbelts.
I'll be working.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
You're too polite.
I heard that a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
She may not wait any longer.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
She is likely to live to be one hundred.
It's nearly three o'clock.
That architect builds very modern houses.
Tom takes a bath every evening after dinner.
She is fond of singing old songs.
I want to know who told you that.
It's already seven.
Why are your eyes so big?
That's our house.
It is finally all over.
Tom wanted to know where it happened.
Fill this out, please.
We heard the sound of gunshots.
Don't act like you don't know how to dance.
I see them.
She left home ten minutes ago.
I know how women think.
Did you come here by train or by bus?
We should proceed with great caution.
Why are you calling Tom?
You can always text Tom.
Tom decided to go home early.
Please call the fire department.
You're cool.
Where's your dog?
Can you explain what PKO stands for?
The cuffs of his suit jacket are badly frayed.
Push the door open.
That boy is running.
Please turn off the TV.
I like things the way they are.
I didn't think you'd tell me.
I spent the whole day reading a novel.
You're going to be OK.
I'd like another cup of coffee.
I already gave you half.
I'm going to wear these shoes on our date tonight.
We can rely on Tom.
Do whatever you want about it.
Don't you feel like going to the movies?
Tom does not want to be late.
Has Tom's dog ever bitten Mary?
Your idea is similar to mine.
I like writing songs about relationships.
How much does it cost?
What's wrong with the way I'm dressed?
I just want to be your friend.
Would you like to go to a movie tonight?
We have walked all around the lake.
It is a pity you cannot come.
He got up earlier than usual.
The school was established in 1650.
The experiment succeeded.
I don't know how long I can stay.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize you.
After days of warm weather, it became cold.
Take care of it.
I'd be delighted if they asked me to give a speech.
I drove the car into the garage.
Tom called Mary every day.
Why are you so tired?
I was trying to be supportive.
They're lucky to be alive.
He goes to the office by car.
OK. Go ahead.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
Nobody cares for me.
When did you see him?
Do your own job.
Tom isn't trained.
When Tom opened the door, he saw Mary standing there with a six-pack and a pizza.
We need to go.
I think you have a problem, Tom.
I've got plenty of money.
Where did you learn all that?
It's two miles from here to the station.
He's here to protect you.
You're joking, of course.
Shakespeare created many famous characters.
Our dog buries bones in the garden.
Do you want him to know about it?
Where is the coffee shop?
I had a good time during the trip.
I can't feel at home in a hotel.
When are you going home?
I'm not that kind of girl.
I should've listened to you.
Urgent business kept me from coming sooner.
Wine is made from grapes.
I haven't seen her in years.
Something's not right.
I didn't have enough space to fit my lunch in the bag.
You're not that interesting.
I'm not the coach.
Let's see if I've got that right.
He could always tell which direction the wind was blowing.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I ate some Greek food at a nearby restaurant just a few days ago.
I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
Do you study French every day?
They spent the afternoon around the pool.
Don't pay attention to her.
She got the money from him even though he said that he wouldn't give it to her.
We can save you some time.
Stay away from the door.
I was a little afraid.
I work for a hospital.
He drinks to excess.
Lychees taste of grapes.
Watch closely.
Refreshments will be served afterwards.
I don't need your job.
The rumor was without foundation.
I'm familiar with the situation.
Your French is perfect.
You don't understand.
Everybody knows me.
He served his king faithfully.
Do you really want to work with us?
Do not talk with your mouth full.
I understand the sentence, but I'm not able to translate it.
Do you think you've made the wrong choice?
You're not bored, are you?
I really ought to go.
I just want you to listen.
I can't afford it.
They're not coming back.
I'm training for the triathlon.
She hung up in silence.
How many are there in your class?
I broke a bone in my foot while exercising.
This does not bode well.
They fit each other so perfectly.
I just don't believe you.
I need to get something.
Did you write your name?
I met him in Tokyo by chance.
You have to stay fit.
You had a choice.
Japanese love to soak in a hot tub before bed.
The financial crisis has left many unemployed.
You were terrified, weren't you?
I want you and me to be happy.
I refused for personal reasons.
Do you speak English?
I may not get anything I asked for.
Please show me your stamp album.
Are you accusing me of something?
Compared to Tokyo, London is small.
Look at the cat.
I'll be there in an hour.
I'm aware of that possibility.
Let me push the button.
The girls giggled.
She and I are in the same class.
Please lower the window.
I hope you'll come.
Just get off the stage.
I dream about you quite often.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
I felt uncomfortable.
If you were more ambitious, you could go a long way.
It happens more often than you would think.
He kept his promise.
Is that unreasonable?
I never for a moment imagined we wouldn't get home before the storm hit.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've got a small problem.
It's normal to make mistakes.
Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
Let's come back to it later.
My bedroom is crawling with spiders.
We walked along the beach.
Let her sleep.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I have a horse.
She could feel her knees shaking.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
What a strange woman!
They are approaching.
She likes talking best of all.
Tom did all he could do to help.
I was surprised because my husband actually ate some of our wedding cake.
Whip the egg-whites until they are stiff.
I gave Mary a book.
We'll try not to let it happen again.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
Does he go to school by bus?
Turn the radio up a little.
You can't do this to yourself.
He may be a genius.
My mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
Does anyone else use your account?
I want to show you something I've been working on.
Tom and Mary both said no.
He proposed an alternate plan.
The squirrel was busy gathering nuts.
Tom hurt his knee when he fell.
Tom was your guitar teacher, wasn't he?
The chief justice will swear in the president.
She advised him to come back at once.
It looked like a gun.
I regret that decision.
Doesn't it interest you a little?
The thief is certain to be caught eventually.
How big is it?
Why don't I have a girlfriend?
Our train is late.
Thirteen homes have been destroyed.
I regret having told you.
Keep your room clean.
I hate my voice.
He threatened me, but I wasn't scared.
I'm a very lucky man.
I am right for once.
I can't live alone.
You don't have to come.
I'm desperate.
This coat is too short on me.
My wife is a good manager.
I know you hired a lawyer.
There she comes.
Look up the new words in your dictionary.
The floor gave way.
They kept their love a secret.
You shouldn't always do what everyone else seems to be doing.
That's not what I wanted to do.
We don't trust strangers.
When was the last time you saw the sunshine?
I don't want to work at a supermarket all my life.
Quit behaving like a kid.
Well, are you coming?
Do you really want to win?
I really appreciated your help yesterday afternoon.
I met Mary yesterday.
I thought that Tom was kind.
She looked worried about her school report.
Let me find out.
Don't tell me what to do.
Having been convicted of murder, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
It's a fine day.
I will help you when I have finished my work.
Both are alive.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
That might change things.
I can't bear to see him cry like that.
You were jealous, weren't you?
I'd like to see that.
A woman was hanging the washing on the line.
Tom asked us to sit down.
Air is a mixture of gases.
Go see a doctor.
She is making dinner.
It is an endangered species.
You're careless.
They're boring.
You don't have to answer.
I thought that you wanted to go with us.
Dial 110 at once.
I don't even know you.
Can you read Arabic?
You weren't serious, were you?
He was moved to tears when he heard the news.
We're not desperate yet.
Don't lose your sense of humor.
You can do whatever you want to do, of course.
Live and learn.
The victim declined to press charges.
It's very dry.
Tom was dying.
The house has burnt down.
He said, "I want to be a scientist."
What a fool I was!
I ignored Tom.
I saw a house with a red roof.
Stay out of the water.
We shared everything.
Did you pay somebody to write this for you?
I'm eating an apple.
I can't put up with all that noise.
My father is always getting angry.
Tom may not be as happy as he seems.
I can't do two things at once.
It's 99.9% effective.
This carpet is beautiful.
Everybody thought so.
Don't let Tom frighten you.
He told me to leave the window open.
I take it you know Tom pretty well.
Tom had no idea how to do it.
Tom says he was busy.
This glass isn't mine.
You're lying now.
Tom wants to speak.
Don't talk during class.
I didn't realize my wallet was missing until I got home.
I can't control what happens.
My throat's a little dry.
Tom fainted as soon as he saw the needle.
I prefer to remain seated.
Roses smell sweet.
I look forward to our next meeting.
I thought I was going crazy.
I thought you hated me.
What were you doing at that time?
As long as we live, we have to work.
We can't go there.
I forgot to buy eggs.
Did you do your homework by yourself?
He volunteered to help her.
What are some foods you only eat in the evening?
One must observe the rules.
I'll stay here.
My father is very nice.
You have to go.
Be careful!
Would you teach me?
There's nothing we can't do.
Which woman is your aunt?
What did you do yesterday?
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
I want everything to work out just right.
Tom went pale.
You can't give up, Tom.
The crops have withered.
They announced the date of their wedding in the newspaper.
I'd like to hear exactly how Tom managed to get that old car running again.
Let me call you back.
He was among those chosen.
Tom skipped dinner saying he was too tired to eat.
Are you still upset about what happened?
Don't be upset.
Just a minute. I'm coming.
Tom is there.
Did I hear you right?
That's why I came back so soon.
He was born rich.
A number of passengers were injured.
Don't eat without me.
This is a very low-stress job.
Do you like surprises?
You have the necessary skills.
I'm a little child.
He often quotes from Shakespeare.
We have to make sure that we never do this again.
Let me off at the train station, please.
Tom knows a girl named Mary.
Go play in traffic.
Tom studies at Harvard.
Could you tell me your mobile number please?
They're not dead.
Would you mind if I have a look?
They died one after another.
I can't drive myself home.
He tricked me.
She's too loud.
I don't like to inhale someone's smoke while I'm working.
Here he comes.
Her teacher praised her.
I'm afraid we're out of time.
I didn't do this, did I?
Don't you hang up on me.
The place is worth visiting at least once.
I am a fast swimmer.
You're not helping.
How long have you lived in Japan?
He lives in Nagasaki.
I agree with the opinion that real estate is overpriced.
You must let me handle this.
What are you hiding?
If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know.
Tom is too tired to help you today.
He died suddenly.
We can pay.
She didn't telephone after all.
That company hires people without regard to race, religion, or nationality.
You are free to leave any time you wish.
The best place to hide something is in plain sight.
Never argue with a drunk.
I'm afraid this key does not fit.
Don't underestimate my power.
This is what I can do for you.
We discussed the problem all afternoon.
This room is comfortable.
A lot of people do that.
Keep out of my way.
This custom dates from the Edo period.
All plants need water and light.
I'd rather live in peaceful poverty than in wealth and fear.
It might be a long time before you see me again.
Did you drop it?
I don't like big dogs.
I cross the railroad tracks every morning.
Tom opened the trunk of the car.
You have to choose your own destiny.
I have been busy.
Where have you been all this time?
Are you close to your family?
Why don't you go on a diet?
The coffin was loaded into the hearse.
I'd like to take this with me.
I really needed it.
I'm a stranger here.
He said that if he were there, he would help her.
All the names are listed in alphabetical order.
This is kind of embarrassing.
This diamond is fake.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
They say she's sick.
Do you like it then?
How long do you have to eat lunch?
We are still clinging to the dreams of our youth.
Can you promise me that?
You run into Japanese tourists everywhere.
He was curious about how it would taste, so he took a small bite.
I won't be getting married this year.
Milk does not agree with me.
How much more suffering can they endure?
He touched my hand.
Tom watched admiringly.
Let me explain it with a diagram.
I can't say I'm sorry.
I constantly quarrel with my wife.
He changed his job.
We divided ten dollars among the five of us.
Why are these photos so important?
We haven't seen Tom in a while.
We're speechless.
Everybody likes to goof off.
It is raining hard.
You're the leader.
How many men have you killed?
I just want to hear your reasons.
Don't ever call me again.
This door is locked from the inside.
I have no friends.
No one speaks this language anymore.
How do I know this isn't another one of your tricks?
On Sunday we were on the beach flying a kite.
We improved the quality.
How's the party going?
Tom took a quick shower.
This may change next year.
How did you lose so much weight?
What is the exchange rate today?
Where's your house?
They're downstairs.
Who'll be the first to die?
Call them this evening.
Her nails are red.
Have you been told where the meeting will be?
That girl looks boyish.
My father is always forgetting things.
Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess.
Take the road on the right.
Show us the solution.
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
I thought we could get together later.
I've been studying French for three years.
If you rest, you will be back on your feet again soon.
Tom knows he shouldn't have said that.
She doesn't like the way I speak.
Silence is golden.
I can't stop coughing.
You're a good man.
Tom is very likely to succeed.
I think you should stick to your training schedule.
Go straight on down this street.
Please write down your name, address, and phone number here.
Would you do that if you had the chance?
I'm sorry.
This is justified.
Tom climbed into his truck.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
I have not been able to go to school for a week.
It's bound to happen sooner or later.
The hunter shot a bear.
Is she your only daughter?
I used my imagination.
This is a big deal.
You were great.
You're very lonely.
Where does it leave from?
I haven't talked to anyone but Tom today.
Tom doesn't remember turning off the light.
I'm done with you.
It looked real.
I'm at work.
The men are eating lunch.
They're all nuts.
I've just arrived at the station.
I told Tom I was going to handle it.
I didn't take part in the conversation.
Hold that thought.
Black Americans continued to suffer from racism.
I have to go back to the office.
A word spoken is past recalling.
They drive on the left in England.
Her daughter can recite many poems.
The child came near being drowned.
Come with me.
This is a matter of the utmost gravity.
This candy costs eighty cents.
I should've put on some sunscreen.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
Give the book to whomever wants it.
That's really great!
He drank the whisky as if it were water.
It is more blessed to give than to receive.
I don't have travel insurance.
Tom wanted Mary to know that he didn't hate her.
How many counties are there in Florida?
He is roasting coffee beans.
Ring the bell when you want me.
No matter how often I tell her, she keeps making the same mistake.
Please tell me.
It's not your fault.
Tom was unreliable.
Cutting a cake into equal pieces is rather difficult.
Where does he live?
Would you mind coming earlier next time?
Her hobby is collecting stamps.
In the desert, water is worth its weight in gold.
As far as I know, he's guilty.
How awful!
This tastes a lot better than what I usually eat.
Is this a dream?
Have you finished writing that song you've been working on?
Tom really wants to be your friend.
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?
I haven't formed an opinion about that yet.
She told him all about her childhood.
I couldn't find a cab last night.
You know what they can do, don't you?
Good lumber is hard to find these days.
I was overwhelmed.
She's pregnant.
Keep an eye on the child for me for a moment.
It's close by.
How much time did we lose?
Whose bicycle is this?
You should tell the truth.
They're staring at you.
Do you think so?
They went on an expedition to the North Pole.
We didn't hear you come in.
You're still mad, aren't you?
I would be more careful if I were you.
Now that you've decided to quit your job, you look happy.
If they find us, we're dead.
Could you move just a little closer?
They're bringing him in for questioning now.
It's a common mistake.
I lived in poverty.
Are you still there?
If you tell a lie enough times, you begin to believe it.
You have such beautiful eyes.
There's nothing more I can tell you.
That man looks familiar.
Didn't you hear the voice in the next room?
I want to live forever.
Tom has done something wrong.
My nose is itchy.
I thought you were a decent young woman.
I dropped my earring.
Avoid crossing this street when it is raining.
Where did you have the suit made?
I thought I heard your voice.
Tom bolted the door.
This guy is great.
Take the money and run.
Did I miss the turn?
Tom doesn't sound scared.
That was mentioned.
Yesterday was very cold so I wore a hat.
I remember the letter.
It's never too late to learn.
We went to the beach together.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
I'm teasing.
Please stay at my house tonight.
The lights went out.
I have two daughters and two sons.
May I speak to you a minute?
I don't understand what's happening.
On my way to the library I met my friend.
I know you don't like me very much.
I want to make amends for my behavior.
They are my friends.
They gave up.
Give me an alternative.
I think you look hot.
Three were wounded.
Tsunamis swept through rice fields and flooded the towns.
If I'd only taken the time to read the instruction manual!
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins.
Legend has it that this house is haunted.
I want to be at home.
I looked for the key.
You're very sophisticated.
I never want to see you get in trouble.
You're not the only one who feels that way.
I know his real name isn't Tom.
This morning I got up earlier than usual.
Let me carry your suitcase.
The damage was done.
This city is 1,600 meters above sea level.
He's accustomed to traveling.
How could you know?
I didn't expect you.
I don't want Tom to be unhappy.
He had no luck in finding work.
They're doing it right.
Is Tom Jackson your real name?
Where were they going?
I am so tired that I can't study.
I spent a great deal of time dealing with that problem last week.
No one will find us here.
I think you panicked.
What's your theory on what happened?
Make it as spicy as you can.
They were better than I expected.
That would certainly make me happy.
We meant no harm.
I'm not your baby.
You must do this alone.
I can't believe I'm really here.
I don't like novels without heroes.
You only really need to sound exactly like a native speaker if you want to become a spy.
Did I surprise you?
Most students walk to school.
Children like fairy tales.
I want to know what's funny.
Ten years is a really long period of time.
This desk is a little too low for me.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't be so outraged.
I have to choose between the two.
He is intelligent.
What are you so happy about?
You don't have to buy water, do you?
I know your brother.
Your answer is wrong.
Are you still sleepy?
There weren't any roses in the garden.
I don't know what you're complaining about.
The most common name in the world is Mohammed.
The train passed through the tunnel.
She baked me a cake.
I think Tom will like this game.
Since it was so hot, we went swimming.
Just answer the question.
People like you are never busy.
How is that different?
You don't seem too sure.
Do you have a dictionary?
I get a haircut every month.
She cried bitterly.
I'll try to find one.
They shouldn't be doing that.
Tom disagreed.
Why are you building a wall here?
Yes. You're absolutely right.
Tom seemed very impressed.
Everyone's been contacted.
Father bought me the latest model motorcycle.
You made a wise choice.
My brother's going to kill me.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
The Union soldiers fought fiercely.
I thought you were injured.
He got well again.
You can't learn that in school.
We were both drunk.
There's a party tonight.
I'm between jobs.
Don't you know how beautiful you are?
I caught the ball with one hand.
Are you happy with that?
She asked me what had become of him, but I didn't know.
Tom says you're a genius.
This is annoying.
Tom is the ranking officer.
So, what do you guys want to do tonight?
I just don't want your dog in my house.

I really doubt it.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Tom's question took Mary by surprise.
I've tried to contact Tom.
That has to be a misprint.

What I want isn't tea, but coffee.
Is this typewriter yours?
We're all vulnerable.
Do you think the shooting was accidental?
I tried to act natural.
I don't mind it here.
That tastes terrible.

I'll let you know if I find anything interesting.
He is beyond help.

Don't forget that good jobs are very hard to come by these days.

Would you please slow down?
Put on your hat.
Are my socks dry already?
I have no idea where we are.
What do you make of that?

How come I've never seen you here before?
Now, this is a problem.
What's standing between us and that happening?
Do you understand that?
I caught them in the act.
It's finally over.
Dinner is ready, so we can eat whenever we want.
She left home after three days.
It's pretty incredible.
Why are you in my house?
Do you mind my making a suggestion?
You don't have to respond.
Get out!
Where did you hear that?
Judging from the look on his face, it seems that he has succeeded.
I don't know who knows.
I ran so I would be on time.
Can you come?
Is he sleeping?
He showed me his collection of stamps.
The speaker should stand where everyone can see him.
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.

You're safe.
I'm sure everything will be OK.
I was unable to go to his birthday party.
Was it hard for you to find my house?
I hope you enjoyed your trip.
I thought they'd heard us.
What did you think I was going to suggest?
I wonder what I'll do once I get home.
You were always very kind.
You look perfect.
Nobody is laughing now.
It's an emergency!
I don't understand what the author is trying to say.
You like that, don't you?
We have more customers than we can count.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
Come on, don't be a coward!
You can do it any way you like.
That's very big.
I wasn't home.
My father is going to make a trip to New York.
This desk is too heavy to lift.
He makes friends with everybody he meets.
You remind me of your father.
The problem was I couldn't speak French.
Don't touch the computer.
What are you still doing here?
We found her alive.
What time did you go to bed last night?
You don't look very strong.
I recognized his face.
This is a lot harder than I thought it would be.
He would often go fishing.
We want to buy a house in Boston.
I want to thank you for your time.
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
I don't care for foreign food.
Organic food tastes better.
Hurry up, girls.
She demanded to see the manager.
Why do you take that medicine?
You guys looked mad.
I'm just going to run down to the bank.
I'm sorry I was rude to you.
They cannot be saved.
Tom introduced himself.
I think he's too young.

It's Tom's thirtieth birthday tomorrow.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
Try it again.

I can't understand what she says.
That is a very complex machine.
May I start eating now?
I'll give you a lift home.
It looks really good.
I think we should quit.
When is your book coming out?
You were sleeping, weren't you?
We won't have much time.
Haven't I seen you before?
I know you've been busy.
I'm not from around here.
He hasn't answered my letter yet.
I was shocked to see this.

I have something for you, too.
You like Boston, don't you?
I attend scientific conferences.
I have made many sacrifices for my country.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
I couldn't sleep.
It's very cold this evening.
Hold this.
It's a shame that you're not coming.

I'm clean.
I had to go back home.
She divorced him after many years of unhappiness.
Where did you find the key?
Could I borrow your car?
Tom isn't a good swimmer.
Sometimes he spends time by himself.
Say please.
This party is awesome.
We can't guarantee that.
He marches to the beat of a different drummer.
I'd like to ask you about a student of yours.
Who's on duty today?
I'll give it a try.
What you did to Tom was cruel.
I often hear her play the piano.
I forgave you a long time ago.
I'll tell you what to say.
You are seriously ill.
I was at a movie theater.
They handled it well.
Help yourself, please.
When does the plane leave?
I hope to see you.
This is good meat.
Can you swim underwater?
Are you Catholic?
How could it have exploded?
I exchanged stamps with him.
I saw him in the park.
Tom will be here tonight.
Do you remember your passport number?

You're very forward.
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
Where did all this come from?
You'd better come.
Do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Tom has done that only once.
He took a week off.
I'm telling you the truth.
Our server will be offline on October 20th for scheduled maintenance.
Do you want to eat this?
Anybody see you?
You are not Japanese.
Tom said he'd play tennis with us.
How do you feel about Tom now?
Tom often talks to his parents on Skype.
Do you need money?
It seems that I have lost my keys.
I like your necklace.
Don't leave town.
This is absolutely wonderful.
Tom and Mary became lifelong friends.
They set the time and place of the wedding.
Can I afford it?
How long have you been studying English?
He can run as fast as you.
The top spun perilously close to the edge of the table.
This is a major environmental disaster.
I filled the bucket with water.
I think I know what this is.
I will ask you once.
Tom lives in a small town not too far from Boston.
Tom is being held prisoner somewhere.
The five of us stood in a circle holding hands.
He is living with his friend for the time being.
When I run, I get sweaty.
I think you're going to survive.
I'm out of place here.
She asked him to sit down.
I've always wanted to write a children's book.
When you leave the room, please make sure you turn off the lights.
Do you do this often?
I always counted you as a friend.
I was late for the appointment.
Do you want me to come cook you something?
Don't act like you don't know how to dance.
He knows he did something wrong.
I think we made the right call.
I broke it.
I don't like goat cheese.
I've analyzed the data.
Show me how to do it, please.
Don't take it personal.
None of this is good.
Bring me the phone, Tom.
It's not like the movies.
Could you take some pictures of us?
There is a man waiting for you at the door.
He always takes his time in everything that he does.
Tom hasn't played the guitar for years.
He's hungry for power.
He tried it over and over again.
It isn't that bad.
I sincerely regret having caused you such an inconvenience.
I'm glad you appreciated that.
I'll help you as much as I can.
He encountered unexpected obstacles.
We met last week.
Tom is three years older than I am.
He is busy preparing for the trip.
It's a great honor to meet you.
I've been away too long already.
Many friends came to see me off.
Opposition to the embargo was growing.
Are you finished?
What kind of training have you had?
Are you a criminal?
I have enough money to buy a car.
Tom could hardly speak French at all when I first met him.
He is no fool.
The article was written in Russian.
I have something for you to do.

They received a box of books.
The cat scratched my hand.
She turned down my proposal.
He married a stewardess.
You must tell me.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
They looked as if they would cry.
As the proverb says, "Time is money."
I admire your dedication.
It wasn't until yesterday that I heard the news.
She showed her guests how to eat what she had prepared.
I've already spoken to Tom about that.
How much did the tickets cost?
The baby was shaking the rattle.
How much money does he have?
I don't see how that would be possible.
I asked Tom to drive me home.
This is exactly what I needed.
It's as good as finished.
Don't move.
Someone might get hurt.
I felt the house shake.
I'm ready for tomorrow.
This is a coconut.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
I'm not giving you any money.
We could understand each other.
How much are these potatoes?
The fire was soon extinguished.
You should make good use of your time.
Get up.
Do you talk to your cats?
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
I use Google every day.
I use it every day.
Tom and Mary had a picnic by the waterfall.
She's dependent on her husband.
How long did it take you to translate this book?
I'll stay a few more days.
How was your nap?
I love you like a son.
She always prides herself on her academic background.
Somebody must break the sad news to her mother.
If I were you, I'd buy that one.
His ideas never earned him a single penny.
Tom's arm brushed against mine.
You should follow the doctor's advice.
When he got into trouble, he turned to his parents for help.
I'll get my coat.
We miss you.
A book is lying on the desk.
I finished it.
I'm crazy about you.
I am about as big as my father now.
Tom goes jogging in the park every morning.
Strange to say, no one voted for the candidate.
That's not happening.
They're in the hot tub.
I was able to find the street, but I couldn't find her house.
I don't believe we've been formally introduced.
There is always the risk of losing all the data on your hard disk.
We were very busy last week.
I know where they will be this afternoon.
It's a good system.
I cannot put up with her behavior.
Any of you can do it.
The first time you meet people, you should be careful about how near you stand to them.
I have something you want.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I'm really shocked.
There are beautiful flowers here and there in the garden.
He kissed her goodbye and left, never to be seen again.
Have you put on weight?
I was very tired, so I went to bed early.
This is amazing.
This could take a while.
You still have a lot to learn.
We didn't reach any conclusions.
We heard what sounded like gunshots.
The show starts in ten minutes.
I'm in charge here.
This is very cheap.
Would you like another piece of pie?
Which do you suppose she chose?
Have you been to Kyoto?
He was wet all over.
Is that an original painting?
Don't forget.
The time has come for you to play your trump card.
Does it offend you?
Tom didn't do his homework.
I forgot his phone number.
Don't you ever say that again.
I'm going to go buy a ticket, so please watch my bags for a minute.
You're never at home.
As far as I know, he's a nice guy.
That's unimportant.
Tom is too young to drink beer.
You are good.
Why was I the only one asking questions?
I know they're still alive.
That's all you're interested in, isn't it?
Mine is not so good as yours.
Your daughter is not a child any more.
I always do the same thing.
Let me check my wallet.
He grew up to be an engineer.
Sometimes everything goes wrong.
Maybe next time.
Which book do you need?
I would very much like to go.
Don't come any closer.
Tom asked an awkward question.
We're starved.
I have a favor to ask.
You're conceited.
Is there much demand for these goods?
Could you pass me the salt, please?
My parents are very old fashioned.
He gritted his teeth and forced back his growing fear.
Did you enjoy yourself last evening?
You have good taste in music.
This nation's economy is growing by leaps and bounds in recent years.
How far is it from New York to London?
The young adapt to change easily.
Can you clean your bedroom?
Ask him his name.
Get in the car.
As soon as she saw me, she greeted me with a smile.
We chose this one.
He was drunk on beer.
I glanced through the brochure.
It is questionable whether this data can be relied on.
Is there anything you'd like to add?
Don't underestimate yourself.
Tom showed Mary something.
I want to buy a new computer.
I was in the right place at the right time.
Doesn't that seem strange to you?
I'm still thirsty.
That's what my friends keep telling me.
I didn't notice.
I read all kinds of books.
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.
My daughter is the apple of my eye.
He is a lazy fellow.
I often go fishing with them.
How well can you dance?
I'm broke and tired.
He shaved his mustache off.
Accidents happen.
Could you put a little sunscreen on my back?
Tom runs fast.
You're tough.
Who do you think came to see me yesterday?
It'll go away.
I lost my credit card.
You can't do two things at once.
Do you like looking in the mirror?
Have you finished the work yet?
He hates spiders.
That's foolish.
I always catch colds in the winter.
Stay awake.
I bought that car.
It's not always like this.
In those days, I used to get up at six every morning.
What's that in your hands?
Mother is in the kitchen.
I've come here to work with Tom.
That's my money.
That is the office where he works.
Are you on your way home?
Our plane is thirty minutes late.
He is a great scientist.
I'm very fat.
I want to be with you more than anything.
I get asked that question a lot.
Tom didn't trust Mary.
You were hungry, weren't you?
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
They live in deplorable conditions.
I smell something rotten.
Are you fully recovered?
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
I am very happy to hear about your engagement.
What time does school begin?
It is not necessarily so.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
As you like.
She didn't want to sell the book.
Let Tom stay home.
It seems that she's happy.
Please fix it.
Nobody seems to have paid attention to what he said.
He answered incorrectly.
How can you be so callous?
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
They want you dead.
I never thought it would be this bad.
Tom has to learn Japanese because he's going to Japan next year.
I feel really stupid.
It was a beautiful sunny day.
The virus is starting to mutate.
I don't want to live by your rules.
We hugged each other.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Follow us.
Give me a table for two near the window.
I'm not ashamed to tell you.
I wasn't offended by that.
She is beautiful like her mother.
He's better at the piano than I am.
Do you see a rose?
You look very tired.
He turned down our proposal.
You have only to touch the button.
This is by far the tallest building in this city.
It would be better for you to speak to him.
I think Tom recognized me.
I'd like to try this.
I'll leave the decision to you.
I like reading American novels.
I am running short of money.
He can't control his desires.
I can't swim.
I expect a subway station will be here in the future.
I found my father's diary which he kept for 30 years.
We can't work without electricity.
You're very emotional.
I serve no one.
Did anyone eat with you?
Let's begin on page 30.
He's deep in debt.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
Tom split up with Mary.
What did your wife say?
Your dinner is getting cold.
She tied him up.
That looks kind of fun.
It can be fatal.
I told you to call me.
Do you read Tom's blog?
It's still too hard to find a job. And even if you have a job, chances are you're having a tougher time paying the rising costs of everything from groceries to gas.
I had a crush on you when we were in high school.
Don't you ever clean your room?
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
When you meet someone for the first time, be careful about how close you stand to that person.
Tom's drowning.
You cannot achieve anything without effort.
I admire your talent.
Do you feel like going for a swim in the creek later?
He doesn't like to wait until the last moment to do something.
I'll fix your wagon.
My father has lived in Nagoya for more than fifteen years.
That's not something I want to think about right now.
The cat doesn't look happy to see us.
Nowadays children do not play outdoors.
We're going to discuss the problem tomorrow.
No one will care.
Solve the problem.
You gotta get more organized.
Did you think I wouldn't tell Tom?
The pickpocket disappeared into the crowd.
Tom never really trusted Mary.
He came to school even though he was unwell.
I'm not your friend.
I feel like I could cry.
I don't want to go to school.
I think I can come over this afternoon.
He can't stop thinking like that.
His sudden appearance surprised us all.
I knew you'd come back for me.
I don't know if there is time.
Tom might be right.
Play outside instead of watching TV.
It's not very good.
It was just a coincidence.
I shouldn't have walked home late at night by myself.
The Olympic Games are held every four years.
She nursed him back to health.
Tom was alone at the time.
They think I'm a millionaire.
I know he will only continue disappointing me, but I can't help loving him.
Do you want a lawyer?
I've heard that Tom is sick.
It's very beautiful.
Why don't you start by telling us what you saw?
Everyone is drunk.
Don't make me do this.
That's a horse of a different colour.
There are a lot of fish in this lake.
Our mothers are strong women.
What did they bring me?
He is a detective.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Could you do this instead of me?
Leave us alone.
You can't charge that much.
Why should we study economics?
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Is it my turn?
My study is upstairs.
What does this mean?
Why are you here?
Nobody knows the answer.
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
All in all, the novel was a success.
You don't understand how worried I was about you.
I know you're afraid of heights.
Each time I see Mary, I learn something new and important from her.
I didn't see you.
How come you didn't come to the party?
When did you go to work?
You're so sweet.
Did you lose your car keys?
Tom taught himself how to ski.
This is Tom's grave.
Don't dismiss any possibility.
My grandfather likes to walk.
They relaxed on the beach.
I want you to handle it.
His ideas sound crazy.
He ordered a chop suey.
If she'd known the results, she'd have been shocked.
Where were all of you?
They are very big.
His story was so funny that everyone could not help laughing.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Wake up!
That dress fit her perfectly.
Do you want to get drunk?
Whose turn is it?
Play that song again.
I can't control myself.
Tom refused to talk.
Choose one person.
I wanted to see Tom.
You'll strain your eyes trying to read in this light.
I lost my key.
I want to eat a steak.
He is as good as dead.
I had my brother clean my room.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
I went into the town in search of a good restaurant.
I understand, but I cannot agree.
That's all I do here.
I figured you'd be impressed.
I love talking to you.
I caught him cheating on the test.
I wonder whether Tom is really serious.
Let's talk over a cold beer.
May I say something?
Tom wants to come with us to Boston.
They took food and clothing.
We are not amused.
We made friends with them.
Please look for it.
She turned down my offer.
You won't find anything here.
Tom has lived in Boston for more than a year.
Prices depend on supply and demand.
Tom said you stole his car.
I told you I'm not drunk.
She is easygoing.
He and I are almost the same height.
I see tears in your eyes.
That was the basic idea.
You need to sleep.
Don't walk so quickly. I can't keep up.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
I never thought it'd be this hard to choose a color to paint the kitchen.
I think I hear them.
Do you have enough information to go on?
I will return to Australia the day after tomorrow.
Tom got special treatment.
It's all OK.
Ten to one, he will succeed.
He will arrive by eight at the latest.
When will he go home?
Everyone did it.
I am not accustomed to making speeches in public.
She has good control over her class.
The soup was too hot.
She could not cope with anxiety.
I'm absolutely sure!
I think I'd like to be your friend.
Tom drank too much.
Do you want fruit juice?
The cake should be done soon.
They spent the entire day on the beach.
Could I see you in private?
That happened almost thirty years ago.
I can't remember his explanation.
How did Tom get caught?
I appreciate how you feel.
Over 100 people were present at the party.
A man must be honest.
They're good friends of ours.
There's a huge mark up on imported electronic goods.
I'm here as a tourist.
I love Australia.
Think it over and let me know what you decide.
Put this in your backpack.
He ran to catch up to his brother.
I never talked to him again.
Whose bicycle did you want to borrow?
I'm glad I invited you.
Some students seem to have forgotten to do their homework.
I called Tom up.
Let the pigs eat that.
I don't want to live my life in fear.
Of course, we believe you.
He's about the same age as you are.
I'm not insane.
Tom is even scared of Mary.
Let me try again.
She's a professor.
I've saved the best for last.
He's from Georgia.
He has promised never to be late again.
I had stuff to do.
Cats like boxes.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
We know this is real.
They say that a large dam will be built.
I know it was you.
Tom wants to apologize to you.
Humor me.
We'd better get out of here.
I don't want this shirt.
They want to kill me.
Tom should do what Mary says.
He looked at his watch.
I have no money with me.
You seem to be a kind man.
Excuse me, is there a toilet nearby?
Who's next on the list?
I'm a bit short of money now.
She went shopping.
Someone left the water running.
Today is election day in Poland.
Tom is writing on the blackboard.
I had to see a doctor yesterday.
Tom woke up at the crack of dawn.
He was very fun.
Don't stand near me.
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
They don't know what they should do with the money.
I want you to keep your eyes open.
He asked her where her mother was.
Mind your own business!
Meet me at the hotel bar.
I feel like smiling.
Is your mother at home?
He thought it was hilarious.
Tom thinks Mary will be upset.
The match was cancelled due to the heavy rain.
Easy come, easy go.
Who put that there?
Is it dangerous?
What's it smell like?
I got the engine going.
I opened one eye.
What on earth is it?
That is new a shop which opened last week.
People do that all the time.
You said you didn't care.
I'll help you look for Tom.
I don't have a clue.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
Let's get started right away.
He is on another line.
I had a call from her for the first time in a long time.
Turn left at the second traffic light.
Don't worry about what needs to be done and get some rest.
I learned French in school.
I'm Tom's French teacher.
Do you plan to go overseas?
I just stayed quiet.
On weekends, I take my dogs out for a long walk in the park.
How did you get interested in art?
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
Tom answered the question correctly.
She is not ashamed of her misconduct.
I heard a noise in the bedroom.
We look after him.
I was attacked.
Let me take that.
It's not like you're going to get arrested or anything.
The train is 30 minutes overdue.
They say that he is seriously ill.
Did you have a lot of happy experiences in your childhood?
Why didn't you read the magazine?
Would you like to tell me something else?
I had to go back.
You're such a liar.
I'm not done with you.
I'll never understand you.
I was in Boston in October.
I want you to want me.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
He's a grown man.
How dare you speak to me in that tone!
Get out of my life!
That did occur to me.
This dog is almost human.
How dare you to talk in that tone with me!
Who's Tom looking at?
It doesn't make any sense, does it?
He can't be trusted.
I asked Tom if he knew Mary.
I realized that even though I wanted to eat, I didn't have enough time.
You'd better go to see your family doctor at once.
I had a job when I was your age.
Thanks for the invitation, Tom.
Are you sure you can do this?
This program is broadcast every other week.
Don't make me ask you again.
I don't think I can do that.
Don't go out in this heat without wearing a hat.
The horse is thirsty.
My hobby is reading comics.
Is your mother at home?
Will you go to the dance with me?
I didn't understand Tom's explanation.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
I need more time.
They might be taller than you.
I'd help you if I could.
He doesn't drink.
Someone is watching us.
Is it hard to fool you?
That man is strong.
He put milk in his coffee.
I'd like to go for a walk.
This is so stupid.
That's what I want most.
My father is a doctor.
Let's play some video games to kill time.
Show him how to do this.
Whales are not fish. They are mammals.
Are you absolutely sure of that?
He goes to school by bicycle.
I wonder what that's used for.
Do a better job next time.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Why are you angry with him?
I told you you had to go home. Why are you still here?
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.
I have never seen such a beautiful girl.
Have you read the FAQ?

It has no parallel.
It was not clear what she really meant.
I walked about a mile.
I was a bad student.
He became ever more famous as a critic.
I need to make a few calls.
You guys can do it if you try.
Tom asked Mary to the prom.
Have you learned nothing from your mistakes?
Would you be friends with me?
He said that he would call you later.
He may come and see us tonight.
He had the gall to ignore my advice.
Tom should probably tell Mary he's sorry.
It is not the best solution.
I gave her my word I would be back home by nine.
Tom knows that.
I love my brothers and sisters.
He was the only witness of the accident.
I don't want to see you.
The airplane took off on time.
Don't believe everything people tell you.
They made us work all night.
That doesn't explain what happened, does it?
Lie down on your left side.
Do you live in the city?
Respect your elders.
He let us go.
She gave him some food.
He's cleaning out his closet.
I'm skinny.
Things took a sudden turn for the worse.
Slow down.
Tom never sings in public.
They answered my questions with difficulty.
I don't want to go with you.
You have no right to be here.
Tom has to stay in Boston this weekend.
It's thirty degrees below zero.
I can't go any farther.
We are traveling on a tight budget.
Tom knows the man Mary came with.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
He was petting the dog.
That was then and this is now.
I got first place.
You're missing the point.
He often eats fish for dinner.
Beware of pickpockets here.
The children were sliding on the ice.
They robbed me blind.
Death is preferable to dishonor.
Tom ran out of the room.
I will take it.
Who is your friend?
Did I miss something?
I'm a respectable businessman.
She says she's not dating anyone now, but I don't believe her.
Does that price include soup and salad?
We hope to see you again.
She never wears green.
I don't know where I should look.
Athletes usually abstain from smoking.
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
I wouldn't want anyone to see us.
Don't ask me why.
He was cheating.
I hadn't thought of that.
I suppose you're hungry.
I recovered.
I went to a shoe store yesterday.
I have few books.
I think death is preferable to shame.
We drink our tea with sugar.
I think we need to find out why Tom wasn't here yesterday.
I no longer believe that.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
My family isn't such a big family.
Do you trust anyone?
It almost worked.
They found out.
Tom will be there.
He is just my age.
Between you and me, Tom's idea doesn't appeal to me very much.
I didn't know you were so tired.
What color is Tom's dog?
What are your conclusions?
Let's do something different.
Don't call anybody.
She liked that.
I hurried so I wouldn't miss the train.
I feel awful about what I said.
I'm really busy today, otherwise I would accept.
Digital music is becoming more and more popular.
It is sometimes difficult to make yourself understood in public.

Let me know when you will arrive at the airport.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
How are you connected?
You should be proud of yourselves.
Don't be sorry.
We lost.
She was advised by him not to borrow money from his friends.
Do you want to sleep on the couch?
I really see no reason to leave.
You can't get on this bus.
I can't help it.
I realized I wasn't ready.
They plan to get married tomorrow.
Oranges have a lot of vitamin C.
Where did you get your hair done?
Do not interfere!

I was lucky.
You were told to stay on the ship.
Do you have something else in mind?
I don't know about you, but I'm starved.
The coffee was so hot that I couldn't drink it.
Don't be afraid.
We rented a canoe.
I can't tell you everything I've been told because I've been told not to.
He promised not to tell that to anyone.
I can carry that for you if you'd like me to.
Yesterday I stumbled across a copy of my father's family register.
You gotta get more organized.
Corporal punishment is still allowed in many countries.
Remember to lock the door.
My meals are prepared by my mother.
What he did wasn't wrong.
She made me a cake.
What do you say we go for a swim?
I have to be there by 7:00.
I'd rather read.
Say which one you would like.
I thought you'd never get here.
Are you actually serious?
Tell me this isn't happening.
Have you been working there for long?
I made a bad decision.
I don't need a wheelchair.
My father won't allow me to do that.
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping.
French was the language of diplomacy.
Tom tightened the knot.
Tom knew that Mary was in Boston.
You said you were going to handle it.
Remember these rules.
Sorry, I'm a stranger here.
Look into the box.
Let's get the party going.
If I can do it, so can you.
We're both witnesses.
Are we done?
Did anybody see you?
I haven't been sleeping well lately.
I want to show you something in my office.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I respect you and your opinions.
What illness do I have?
How did you answer Tom?
How old were you when you got married?
Charity begins at home.
We're going to fight.
I can't smoke.
Something's happened to it.

Don't tell her about it.
His story made us laugh.
He doesn't know how to play golf.
What is the number?
You need a lot of water.
They found each other.
Tom wore a straw hat.
It's raining hard.
I want you to come back early.
Why are you irritated?
He hung an old, wooden oar on his wall as a decoration.
The reason is pretty obvious.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
I've had enough.
Not everybody graduates.
You should bone up on your French before your trip to Marseille.
If I won the lottery, I'd buy you a new car.
We want to speak with Tom.
Don't you think we deserve some answers?
Everybody makes mistakes, don't they?
Are you sure you're not taking on too much?
I've been having some bad luck.
You need to be more careful from now on.
He loves coffee.
They tried to cheer me up.
Please forgive me for not having written to you earlier.
I'll let you know.
What're you doing here?
I'll do what you ask.
I can't confirm this.
You've already forgotten.
If you don't keep the silverware polished, it'll lose its luster.
Can't you hear all the car horns honking behind us?
He came late as usual.
We're baffled.
What will you have to drink?
He belongs to our tennis team.
He cannot write his own name.
Even though the accident was six months ago, my neck still hurts.
We started a band because we were bored.
You wouldn't understand. It's a girl thing.
I like the way you think.
Tom's dying.
I have an old car.
It's better you don't know.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
You're very brave.
Do you think this rope is strong enough?
There are cherry trees on both sides of the street.
You should be out of here by tomorrow.
My sister has a sweet tooth.
Tom died when he was 97.
Take out the trash.
It's forbidden.
The clerk waited on them immediately.
I am not your enemy.
You must not behave like this.
He began his meal by drinking half a glass of ale.
You've told me that joke before.
I had a nightmare.
I want to focus on that.
I won't be running for mayor.
He should have kept his mouth shut.
Please give me this book.
That's a funny thing about people like you, you don't want to get your hands dirty.
It all depends how you handle it.
I figured you would understand.
I knew this wouldn't work.
This is the perfect location.
Why don't they just come and get us?
I'm looking for a wallet.
I bought the book yesterday.
We're going east.
Why give them anything?
Everyone looks the same, except the one standing on his head.
I tried flying from the top of the tree.
You're winning.
Tom used to be a journalist.
Must I write in ink?
I had a nice chat with her.
I want to see you in your office in half an hour.

You've got to stop this now.
It's right.
You like classical music, don't you?
Give us a minute, OK?
All journeys begin with a first step.
I can't see it.
Do not give in to those demands.
You have no idea who that is, do you?
There's danger that the levee will break. We have to evacuate immediately.
Tom knew that Mary was busy.
I have a website.
If you're happy, I'm glad.
He took a step forward.
I like traveling by train.
Tom is making me do this.
Tom is hiding behind the couch.
You're very sophisticated.
We can either go to the beach or go mountain climbing. We can't do both.
I don't care as long as you are happy.
I think it's a fair decision.
I love this show.
Did you watch TV last night?
Read the bottom of the page.
I'll be there in five minutes.
I've got to learn some new songs.
Tom found out the truth.
Be more flexible.
They could've killed you.
Are they still looking for us?
How is that question germane to what we're discussing?
I am going to get dressed.
The palace was heavily guarded.
I'm right in the middle of doing something.
What happened? Why are you crying?
Are you sure you're warm enough?
Don't ever say her name.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
He found me a taxi.
Can he speak Japanese?
You must do this alone.
Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late for lunch.
I really like you.
I do want to open it.
Everyone loves him.
Quite a few people came to the party.
I believed you.
Tom is only five, but he already knows how to read.
I fell down the stairs.
Tom wasn't there yesterday.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I've no idea what's happening.
They calmed down.
You don't look happy.
How much is your hourly pay?
I was so sure this was what I wanted.
That pair of pliers came in handy.
Turn right at the second corner.
I want you to stay on the beach.
I cooked supper last night.
I'm often compared to my brothers.
He is probably dead.
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
Have you ever seen a film this good?
Can you pass me the potatoes?
Tom lost his umbrella.
He neither smokes nor drinks.
Do you think he's sensible?
It would only be a waste of time.
Tom hasn't actually been to Boston yet.
He hasn't left any message.
Where's the whipped cream?
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
Tom started singing.
I applaud your decision to study medicine.
We miss Tom terribly.
She made him cry.
If he is proficient in English, I'll employ him.
Tom won't come home.
Summer is over.
He shook hands with his friend.
I was surprised by what I learned.
The stew smells delicious.
I went to your school.
We were shocked.
You should not go there.
We weren't able to do that.
He enjoys his sleep and doesn't like to have it interfered with.
We won't change anything.
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
I was satisfied.
He went over to the other side.
You know what they say.
I also use this study for receiving guests.
I'm going to stay here for several days.
They said they would accept the committee's decision as final.
We ran a hundred-meter dash.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
Thank you for the information.
These light bulbs can't all be bad.
We have a lot of regular customers.
I'll speak to him at the first opportunity.
I took over the business from my father.
I do not like spring.
I don't know how Tom found out.
The girl went to school in spite of her illness.
They don't teach you that in school.
Can you at least be happy for me?
It's ours.
Tom wasn't flirting.
He mailed a letter home.
You two had a fight today, didn't you?
I'm confused enough as it is.
Do you like Indonesian food?
He's a very nice boy.
My uncle died of cancer of the stomach yesterday.
Just look at him.
Be nice.
She pulled him out of the mud.
He was surprised at the sight of blood.
We need to get rid of Tom.
I love this video.
You had a week to finish this.
It's time.
He dislocated his shoulder.
Tom knew Mary had kissed John.
The factory produces ammunition.
Tom found the problem.
They went to the zoo.
Don't spread yourself too thin.
What's this street called?
He told me that he was busy.
I don't think that that's fair.
Tom saw both Mary and John getting out of their cars.
How long have you been waiting for the bus?
Are they able to read these words?
I don't deny I made a mistake.
We know all this.
It could be anybody.
The children are terrified.
My father hates the summer heat.
Tom said you were good at chess.
You don't need to convince me.
He's not the brightest guy in the world.
Is your daughter blind?
We talked for thirty minutes.
Kabuki is an old Japanese art.
That narrows it down.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
I've got this one covered.
Could you turn down the music, please?
Are you proud of yourself?
They can't do that.
We see what we expect to see.
Why didn't you apply for the job?
I moved back with my parents.
It was wise of you to accept his offer.
Just shut up and listen.
I wonder what his name is.
I got fined.
You should eat something a little more nutritious.
Maybe I'm going through a midlife crisis.
I know what they are thinking.
I just went home without saying anything.
Lay it on the table.
My dream is to go to Japan someday.
I have some money with me.
Keep it in mind.
They never really told me.
I'm outraged.
You seem to know a lot about me.
We abandoned the plan to go on a picnic.
Where are we exactly?
She broke the window on purpose.
It so happened that I had no money with me.
Is that not clear?
We looked at each other.
He's Swiss.
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.
Everybody seems to be having a good time.
Tom didn't come to get Mary.
She started pursuing him before he became famous.
He received a good education in England.
Shots were fired.
I felt sorry for you.
You really lucked out on this one.
There's something fishy going on.
You're not one of them, are you?
If people who smoke are deprived of their cigarettes, they get nervous and irritable.
Thank you for your help.
Does that mean you bought it?
You've got nothing to be scared of.
I was never so humiliated in my life.
The apprentice is lazy.
They did not have much food to eat.
Tom makes more money than Mary.
The military engaged the enemy five kilometers south of the capital.
I'd love to be able to spend less time doing household chores.
I remember this.
I really like this wine a lot.
Tom pretended that he didn't see it.
We enjoyed playing football.
You've gotta get over there right now.
You should assume that Tom already knows about the problem.
I owe my success to his help.
I'd like to talk to you when you have some free time.
We were truly surprised.
I'm sorry, that flight is full.
All this bickering is starting to fray my nerves.
Shut the door, please.
The red hat goes well with her dress.
My bike was stolen last night.
The budget must be balanced.
She took him to the store.
I didn't care.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
The girl was trembling with fear.
I'm watching you.
Your problem is you don't study enough.
The toilet is upstairs.
What time do you usually eat breakfast?
There's nothing more to say.
I don't mean you.
I'd never do what Tom did.
I'm not bitter.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
I have a very good memory.
Everything is going fine.
I really regret doing that.
I didn't know what I was getting into.
Isn't she a doctor?
I wasn't sure I could do it.
I saw what you did.
Tom'll understand.
This is by far the best way.
I could barely walk at that time.
You're a wonderful guy.
I just didn't want you in here.
I never thought that about you.
I read about it in the paper.
I almost feel sorry for you.
Are the children at school?
Getting people to change is extremely difficult.
I can not answer your question.
I can't walk anymore.
He looks very worried.
Will you sing some English songs for us?
You're the one that went crazy.
This armchair is comfortable to sit in.
They cheated the workers out of money.
I'm not sad.
Why don't you tell me about it?
A fire broke out during that night.
He runs well for his age.
The problem is you're not patient enough.
French is an interesting language.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
I consider him a great writer.
I suggested that she go alone.
Poaching is illegal.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
I'd like to make a speech.
The front door remained locked.
The station is a three-minute walk from here.
There is a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
I've never seen my cat act like that.
Tom wasn't in his room.
Am I seeing things?
"Shall I take a message?" "No, thank you."
You can listen to audio files by native speakers on our website.
You don't know the whole story.
It looks really good.
I don't have as much free time as you do.
I wonder if this is really true.
I told her to sit down and to drink a glass of water.
The dogs bayed at the full moon.
You'll give me away.
The visitor sat across from me.
I like it that way.
You should see what Tom can do.
I prefer to do it on my own.
She asked him for some money.
No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to finish that in one day.
I'd like to know why my name was deleted from the list.
How do you stay up to date?
I don't have any problems at all.
May I use your car today?
None of these eggs are fresh.
Spending time with your family should be your priority.
Would Tom like that?
We're almost out of time.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
You're staying with Tom, right?
He thinks he knows best.
I must go alone.
They are all college students.
Do your homework right away.
How could you be so cruel?
I didn't mean to interrupt you.
It was not until yesterday that we noticed the animal missing.
How long were you at school today?
We're just getting ready to eat.
That depends on you.
I was given a nice watch by my uncle.
I don't know when it was exactly.
What crimes have you committed?
Raise your hand.
Tom let us go.
What's the problem with your computer?
She is not afraid of anything.
I thought you were broke.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
Is there anyone else around?
He bought himself a new car.
Tom called Mary every day.
English is spoken in many countries.
Do you agree with what he says in the book?
I know what may happen here.
I'm not proud of it.
As a last resort, read the instructions.
Tom was awesome.
What have you done to yourself?
The reason Tom didn't go with us was because he didn't have enough money.
I have to study.
She never wears green.
Please stop singing that song.
Do you know him at all?
I went aboard.
Which one will you choose?
Whatever happened to your pride?
The fact that I'm here proves that I'm innocent.
Get out!
What he said may well be true.
How long does it take to walk to the station?
I was caught in a shower on my way home from school.
That dress looks really nice on you.
I'm just waiting for a call.
There's nothing I can do.
You aren't permitted to bring dogs into this building.
We should make it if the traffic isn't too heavy.
The doctor told me not to eat too much.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
She walked arm in arm with her father.
We're a good team.
I'd love to get rid of this old car.
Our children all go to the local school.
I don't know the first thing about fishing.
I really misjudged you.
We all consider your idea to be impractical.
Shall I get you a chair?
I'm content with my salary.
He denied it.
I went for a drive in the country.
I am afraid that you will get lost.
Who broke this?
I gather you were hurt.
He fell for it hook, line, and sinker.
What do you call that contraption?
It's been a long time since we last saw each other.
Do you know where the bathroom is?
When you surf the web, you may be tracked by websites.
You can't do this alone.
It's a rough neighborhood.
Tom says he's climbed this mountain three times.
He had been there for ten years before he came to Kyoto.
I can't stop myself.
Where ever did you buy it?
I just want to make sure that his offer has no strings attached.
They probably don't know.
Have you asked if they want one?
I owe you so much.
I just want to get my work done.
I'd like this fight to end.
Everyone is proud of you.
He no longer lives here.
Do I have to attend the party tonight?
Maybe we can fix it.
I got fined.
They should have told us they were moving out.
You're not as good as you think you are.
I translate articles almost every day.
It is better to have old second-hand diamonds than none at all.
I know Tom is in great shape.
I see how you did that.
Can we trust Tom to do that?
The rise in house prices enabled him to sell his house at a big profit.
Come on any day you like.
Tom can't swim as fast as Mary.
Would you mind my opening the door?
Please help yourself to the cookies.
She bought a chicken.
Have you decided?
Waste not, want not.
I can squeeze you in.
She is a child after all.
Last year, I spent so much time by myself that I almost forgot how to communicate effectively with others.
Don't screw it up!
Sorry for not answering your question. I didn't see it.
What did you do with that car?
She was washing the dishes then.
Tom began praying.
A good lie is easier to believe than the truth.
They did not go there.
Is English harder than Japanese?
All's fair in love and war.
Tom is always working.
How long ago did the bus leave?
Tom died in prison ten years ago.
When the results are made public, I'll let you know.
The man looked at me.
I need to go into town.
There must be another way.
Can I call you back?
Can I ask you a question?
They announced that they were getting a divorce.
I gave each child three pieces of candy.
You won't need it.
I don't know if we want to do that.
This is your hat, isn't it?
You are fabulous.
I need to talk with you.
I don't love her anymore.
Are you talking to yourself again?
What an interesting party!
I had everything under control.
I haven't yet eaten anything today.
This is Mary's dog.
He pushed me gently.
Drug addiction is a cancer in modern society.
The council agreed on it.
Would you like to have lunch together?
Take cover!
He regrets having wasted his time.
Are there survivors?
Through genetic engineering, corn can produce its own pesticides.
I never thought you really did that.
Nobody was interested.
She suggested that I write to him at once.
We are going to his house. Want to come with?
She got into hot water when her boyfriend called her at work.
The monkey came down.
We're among friends.
She came back just as I was leaving.
I'll never be as good as you.
She was laughed at by her friends.
May I talk to you a minute?
Look, I'm really busy.
Prices are double what they were two years ago.
He was accused of being a spy.
You are the only one who can help me.
We haven't been paid for three months.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
Put the car into the garage.
This is a pencil.
I think we can handle this.
I don't know her.
Who is your teacher?
Don't try to get up yet.
Are you interested?
What scared you?
The crowd poured out of the auditorium.
We're all ready for that.
You've got a pretty good memory.
He has been playing tennis since this morning.
According to the weather forecast, the typhoon is approaching Okinawa.
Absence of rain caused the plants to die.
Tom is a dog trainer.
Tom isn't feeling at all well.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life alone?
I'm exhausted.
She advised him to give up smoking.
The short answer is yes.
A lot of foreigners visit Japan every year.
Are you willing to take that chance?
She has a strong personality.
I just don't want to do that right now.
I'm not normal.
Tom has just finished washing dishes.
I can't understand the meaning.
Ask Tom to be quiet.
He knows many folk dances.
Where are you?
I appreciate that.
He got more than he bargained for.
The tape recorder was on the table.
Tom disappeared.
Tom maintained that he was innocent.
Why are we even talking about this?
Tom showed his room to me.
I want you to take a look at this.
Does anyone have a match?
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
You've got a one-track mind.
I want to go home and sleep.
It feels like I've known you forever.
You dropped something.
Stop treating me like a child.
They have black hair.
The boss spoke in a condescending tone when addressing the female staff members.
I can help you look for it.
I didn't cancel the meeting.
Don't leave your dog inside all day.
Tom looks a lot like someone I know.
I ate your piece of cake.
She has a few friends.
Let's split.
Tom won't eat it.
Dad knows what he's doing.
He has a huge ego.
Who knows when Tom's birthday is?
I'm not that worried.
I lost the watch that my father gave me.
Cows supply milk.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
Get in. I'll drive you somewhere.
I brought some samples of my work.
I am not a teacher.
I'm in debt to my uncle for $10,000.
I wish I had more time to spend with friends.
We were both afraid to talk.
Tom lives in a cave.
We're just talking.
I would advise you strongly to do what the boss asked you to do.
Does she still have a temperature?
Why don't you tell me why you think it happened?
Workers struggled as factories closed.
I haven't danced in a while.
I went for a drive in the country.
I guess you want me to leave.
I want to take a closer look at that.
Try to hold it together.
Can you tell me what this is?
It helps.
Do you want another one of these?
Not much time is required.
Excuse me, I have to get off at the next stop.
It cannot be done.
I wish you all good luck.
I don't think I said that.
I had a drink or two before you came.
What is it you really want to tell me?
I lit the oven.
I'm pretty happy.
I don't think anybody's going to help you.
And what do I have to do now?
Tom tried to leave.
I will try to do my best.
Let me pay for your coffee.
Tom looks exceptionally bored.
What do they know that we don't?
Tom is photogenic, isn't he?
What's the next station?
I would like to work with your company.
You must not give up hope.
All the children went to bed.
Tom has three cars.
What did Tom tell you about that?
I'll go get the proper forms.
Tom attached the string to the kite.
It's frightening.
She is in her hotel now.
No matter what you may say, I won't change my mind.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
She plays the piano by ear.
I don't know my address yet, I'm going to stay with my friend for a while.
Just keep moving.
Is this your money?
You caught me off-guard.
It's the next logical step.
You're probably too young to understand this.
There was no one to stop Tom.
Do you know the girl waving at us over there?
Please send me a letter as soon as you arrive.
Would you please take my picture?
It's impossible that he forgot our meeting.
You don't know me at all.
Don't forget to write to me.
Tom finished writing the report in less than three hours.
I want to talk to you about this report.
Do you like music?
Mary still plays with dolls.
I finally won.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
It's not just about the money.
You need to be more attentive in class.
It is difficult to talk to him.
I write in my diary every day.
The soldiers are dead.
He couldn't move and had to call for help.
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
I'm not going to get involved.
Where are your car keys?
Do you know where my watch is?
They are not enemies, but friends.
I never had the opportunity to use it.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
He speaks really well.
Can I go to work?
Tom is three years older than you.
I can't help myself.
While driving, mind the potholes.
He sent me a birthday card.
Is there anyone else who wants to eat?
You can go there.
I'd be unhappy if that happened again.
That's the law.
A true gentleman would not betray his friends.
They relaxed in front of the fire.
Let's share the money.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
There was nothing but an old chair in the room.
Are you here to help us?
Don't you remember my name?
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
Somebody stole my car.
That's not the answer.
It's against the rules.
What are you doing here this time of night?
You're very timid.
They left without me.
The hardest thing in life is knowing which bridges to cross and which bridges to burn.
They believe in God.
Will you show me your album?
When does it arrive?
Tom talks quickly.
Tell me you're not serious!
The student made an irrelevant remark.
I met an old man who says that he's never eaten at a restaurant in his whole life.
Can I afford it?
Let me explain the rules.
Why can't you do it?
Did you find Tom?
They're armed.
I don't like to laugh.
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
She made him a new coat.
What's the movie about?
I think Tom needs something.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
What's in the package?
He made me go against my will.
I prepared breakfast for Tom.
That's my dog.
His wish was to go to America.
Don't call me a jerk.
Where is the post office?
I got my right leg injured.
In the winter, I like to stay at home near the fire and listen to the wind blow.
How does that sound to you?
Please speak more loudly.
Tom kept on talking even though Mary had fallen asleep.
Laws differ from state to state in the United States.
It is no good to you.
The botanist studied the flora of the remote island.
Well done, Tom.
He blamed others for his own failure.
I like the sound of that.
I'll do anything.
I'm not old.
I'd like to find somebody to talk to.
The students often copy each other's homework.
You look very dignified.
He goes to the library to read books.
I will do that work on condition that I get paid for it.
I have something to ask Tom.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
We study Chinese.
I couldn't resist the temptation.
Did Tom say why he was fired?
He got out of the cab in haste.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
The tiger was killed.
He held the trophy up high.
You can go there.
I deactivated my Twitter account yesterday.
They stopped talking.
We've had enough of that.
Why did he do such a thing?
I always wanted to go to Boston.
Could you lend me some money?
Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.
Can you tell us about it?
I was at home.
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
We're hot.
She was perfect.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I want to make it up to you.
You shouldn't be afraid of the future.
She burned herself while lighting a cigarette.
My bonus doesn't come close to covering all the loan payments I have to make.
He can't count.
I got dressed in a hurry.
Never tell the truth when a lie will do.
Stop crying.
How many times a week do you spend time doing fun stuff with your children?
Is that important?
How much is your hourly pay?
I am working hard trying to learn English.
It's supposed to be the other way around.
Those men are armed to the teeth.
He left an immense fortune to his children.
I don't know how many minutes we've got.
He achieved his goal.
You're the only person who ever comes to visit me.
I apologize for not replying right away.
That's a very personal question.
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
This house has eleven rooms.
You're very clever.
Sit wherever you like.
You had better go.
We're under attack.
We must destroy the evidence.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
You're powerless.
I almost got a perfect score.
Tom helped Mary open the crate.
You're grounded.
All of us were homesick.
You shouldn't stay up so late at night.
You have no cause for anger.
She dumped him.
He was clearly embarrassed.
They know what's going on.
I let you catch me.
I'm not a drunk.
There's no need to be rude.
I finished last.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
They looked as if they would cry.
She was painfully skinny.
I'll pay you back the money I owe you next week.
How could it not bother you?
Do you want to drink?
I have to get up early.
I think my suitcase was stolen.
No one here has a car.
It's very pretty.
Why are you speaking in French?
Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
Are you fully recovered?
Are you ready for the next problem?
You should eat something a little more nutritious.
I thought I'd surprise you.
Take a sip of this.
We might be able to help her.
Could you come back a little later?
I'm terrible at languages.
We'll paint it.
Jorge can speak four languages.
You don't sound entirely convinced.
We weren't all that busy.
I don't hate you.
I had to decline his offer.
I want you to go upstairs.
Where do you watch television?
Don't come so early next time.
I know that Tom likes basketball.
I will be back soon.
We associate Egypt with the Nile.
Tell me why I shouldn't fire you.
Answer me.
The towel wasn't at all useful.
What do you like about her?
I've never heard Tom complain.
Of course, he is right.
You may eat as much as you want to.
DNA tests showed he was innocent.
The password you have entered is invalid.
Don't let Tom do that.
The cost of living in Japan is going down.
The police searched the premises thoroughly.
There is an urgent need for qualified teachers.
Economic development is important for Africa.
Sit up straight.
He has fallen in love with me.
What movie did you see?
You need to stop ignoring email messages from Tom.
I want to help you with your homework.
Tom didn't tell me why.
Do you have anything to add?
This book isn't worth reading.
You were happy.
I'm only going to show you once.
You're famous.
Are you going to be OK?
Please make yourself at home.
Where is the elevator?
I just followed the recipe.
Did you actually see Tom dancing?
How long did you sleep last night?
I had a hard time getting in.
They did it in front of the staff.
Tom was accused of doing sloppy work.
I'd like to be in a band.
Somebody has to be held accountable for his death.
Tom said he would buy it.
I'm just an average guy.
We finally reached the top of the mountain.
Did you say something?
He's out now.
I'm rarely this angry.
She held him by the sleeve.
You can't control me.
You can get dressed now.
He squinted.
You can't keep this a secret.
My grandmother on my father's side has turned one hundred.
Your French is better than mine.
What do you think happens then?
I don't want you to lie to me.
This road is dangerous.
I just haven't had a chance.
We used to do a lot of things together.
Just ignore what Tom said.
He worked very hard, but could make little progress.
I prefer to be alone.
I know you want to make me happy.
I give you everything you ask for, but you never seem satisfied.
I'm just being me.
I see what you mean.
Ethnic minorities struggle against prejudice and poverty.
He combined two ideas into one.
Tom gets up at six every morning.
I've never met a musician that I didn't like.
Are you thirsty?
There was no damage.
I don't have anything to read.
The cat sleeps next to the couch.
That sounded like a gunshot.
Misfortunes rarely come singly.
I don't think anybody can help me now.
I don't have the money to buy that book.
Should I reply?
Who hired you?
Why did Tom want it?
That is my own affair.
I can't believe you fell for that.
I'm not going to send Tom a Christmas card.
That's a filthy job and I don't want to do it.
Do you think we should just wait and hope it changes?
My new assistant is eager to learn the ropes.
Give me your keys.
Why didn't the police notify us?
It seems to run in the family.
I have to admit I'm curious.
We seized the town after a short battle.
The United Nations sent troops to intervene in the conflict.
I couldn't enter because the door was closed.
I'll handle this.
The child picked up a small stone.
The call is free of charge.
Where is the toilet?
Is the door open?
She heard him cry.
Don't mention it.
Tom ignored our advice.
What's it all about?
What exactly am I paying for?
Tom has secrets.
The park is open to everybody.
He fell and hurt his leg.
Did I hear you right?
I only slept for three hours.
We can't give up.
I don't recognize this shirt. Whose is it?
You need written permission.
He didn't look like a clever boy.
I went to school.
It'll come in handy.
Why don't you go take a nap?
The room is being painted by him.
All the desk drawers were empty.
I don't have any close friends.
Is Japanese taught in your school now?
I'd be happy to sing for you.
"Will you pass me the sugar?" "Here you are."
They never found out the truth.
It has been snowing on and off.
You're off the hook.
Your answer is wrong.
She got a master's degree three years ago.
I've seen my dog sneeze but never my cat.
Do you have plans for dinner?
Get off at the next stop.
You don't see that every day.
I was born the year the war ended.
Tom is on the go day and night.
Call off your dogs.
The server is down again.
Did you already do your homework?
I'm not wearing socks.
Parents need a lot of patience.
When I was in New York, I happened to meet my old friend.
No one knows what to do.
Mozart's life was very short.
Tom committed suicide in prison.
That's the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
You stick out like a sore thumb.
I did nothing illegal.
I usually agree with Tom.
I'm desperate.
He sent me a letter saying that he could not see me.
Stop speaking in riddles.
I've never told anyone that before, not even my mother.
"Everything accomplished starts with the dream of it," is a saying we all know to be true.
I actually think it's a very good idea.
Tom has made a decision.
You have many friends.
I want you back today.
I'd like a receipt, please.
I'm amazed by the rate at which industries grow.
I want you to know that I believe you.
Tom was able to help Mary.
You can't deny that anymore.
Try to be more punctual from now on.
They arrived in Paris at the same time.
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
My house is north of the library.
The pain hasn't gone away.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
There is no wine in that bottle.
You're so sweet.
Maybe Tom knows something.
It seems to me that she has a tendency to exaggerate.
We didn't stay in Boston.
He is a jealous man.
Do you want the job or not?
Tom didn't answer his phone.
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
I really can't talk about this.
We're very grateful for your hospitality.
How much is this?
Be careful!
Can you climb the tree?
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
You must start at once.
I'd be delighted if you could join us for dinner.
I managed to acquire the book after a long search.
We're volunteering.
There is a solution though.
Why not just tell Tom?
I need some help here.
Tom is trying to get it right.
What's this?
Rabid dogs usually foam at the mouth.
I'm persevering.
She just laughed the matter off.
You don't have to apologize.
I feel betrayed.
I didn't know where else to go.
This water is a little salty.
I have many talents.
I enjoyed this book.
I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.
Would you be willing to write a letter for me?
Leave your hat and overcoat in the hall.
These trousers are too large.
Why don't you read it for yourself?
We had a large audience.
This may be your last chance.
I am delighted to be here.
I just want to be your friend.
There are five fish in my aquarium.
Everyone needs to work together.
He uses honey instead of sugar.
Did you see the news?
Don't you understand what's going on here?
I can't open the door. Do you have the key?
He deals in grain.
It's redundant.
Are they all nuts?
He can't do this kind of work, and she can't either.
It's deeper than that.
It may freeze next week.
Don't miss this amazing opportunity.
You should have seen him.
I should get back upstairs.
He was too short to get at the grapes.
Why not spend the night?
When did you visit your friends?
He promises not to drink anymore.
My battery is almost dead.
Can I talk to you for a second, please?
We talked about it all night.
I thought that was the right thing to do.
We're better than they are.
I had my purse and commuter ticket stolen while I was sleeping in the train.
I love baking.
I want to know who paid for this.
I don't plan to be here that long.
You seem depressed.
You're very busy.
Why not wait until tomorrow?
Of course I remember you.
Don't forget we have to do our homework.
My fuel line broke.
Tom told me you hit him.
How much longer are we going to wait?
"Is it going to clear up?" "I hope so."
You're out of luck.
Give me something I can cut this with.
It will make little difference whether you go there by taxi or on foot.
I just want to get it over with.
Tom can't give you an answer now.
Anybody want a lift?
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
I'm a citizen of the world.
How did you become involved in this project?
Tom is her brother.
I didn't see any tigers.
You don't know who I am.
I have a slight fever today.
I'll never be as good as you.
Tom was proud of you.
Let me go alone.
They were afraid of being overheard.
Are those my earrings?
What's causing that sound?
She liked tennis and became a tennis coach.
It looks like snow.
He has no interest in politics.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
My parents have just arrived at the station.
I have complete faith in my doctor.
You're fashionable.
Please help yourself to the chocolate cake.
What did they hit you with?
She thanked me for the present.
Tom probably can't do that as well as I can.
I stayed.
I almost believe you.
I'm smarter than you.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
My coworker really knows how to suck up to the boss.
How's your wife, Tom?
I know you're not planning on staying here for a long time.
I've packed my suitcases already.
Believe me, everything he's told you is a crock.
Would you like some coffee?
We have medicine for you.
You can't erase the past.
Tom started yelling.
What did you eat for breakfast?
Look at yourself in the mirror.
You're very nice.
I thought we could do better.
I met him yesterday.
How did you know that man was a cop?
Comb your hair before you go out.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Who is Tom?
She wept bitterly.
It happened just the way you predicted.
Did you learn to swim when you were a child?
I really think we need to talk.
I got dealt a bad hand.
I need to travel.
I'm broke and tired.
A passport is usually necessary when you travel overseas.
Please answer my question.
She was shocked when she heard his story.
Who developed it?
We'll see what Tom has to say about that.
I don't want that kind of responsibility.
May I cut in?
Do you know what happiness is?
He feels relaxed when he's playing the guitar.
I'd like to have you on our team.
You're too weak.
He secretly showed me her picture.
He is thick-headed.
The car bumped the tree.
Unless you start now, you'll be late.
I wonder who that girl is.
We've no choice.
I must've missed something.
I can't believe we're talking about this.
We avoid talking about politics.
My book has to be somewhere in the room.
What's this green stuff?
Come off it!
This is pretty.
This approach has worked before.
It is up to you to decide what to do.
I want you to stay a little longer.
She almost drowned.
We don't know what they want to use it for.
It's very expensive.
How do you know which one is yours?
You bought it from Tom, didn't you?
I'd like to talk with you.
We can deliver it this evening.
Even though Tom used to be my best friend, I'm beginning to hate him.
Can I get your attention, please?
I am certain that he will quit his job.
Tom works for a translation agency.
A Persian cat was sleeping under the table.
I did no such thing.
I think I've seen this movie before.
It's one of those moments.
He says that he enjoyed it very much.
Christmas is coming.
I have misjudged you.
Let me know your address.
How did you come to know one another?
Get out of the way.
Was anybody else there?
I just want to look at it, that's all.
His face was covered with mud.
I'll study your report.
It wasn't much of a storm.
Why should I tell the truth if you won't?
Is that why you want to hurt me?
Tom and Mary arrived in Boston at the same time.
Can you continue?
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Circumstances forced us to put off the meeting.
Tom is job hunting.
We must sleep at least seven hours a day.
We have five days to go before the summer vacation.
I'm not married.
I don't know what it is, but it's something very big.
How many more of you are there?
She weeded the garden.
I bet five dollars that he will not come.
I don't have one.
I'm rather shy.
I don't know how to do that.
I think we should all go to Tom's house.
Light the candles.
You should go home now.
I hate to see you like this.
I love walking barefoot on the grass.
She is more of an acquaintance than a friend.
What is my room number?
I'll show you how to do it.
I got there in time for the train.
You shouldn't read people's private letters without permission.
The towel was quite useless.
I don't know about you, but I'm starved.
They're speaking French.
Get me the evidence.
My wisdom teeth are coming in.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
They were drinking champagne.
Tom enjoys watching sports on TV.
He regrets his mistake.
That doesn't sound so good to me.
We were lucky.
Tom isn't the only one here who's a good singer.
My mother is preparing supper.
Make a decision.
Why are you alone?
You're good.
I can't answer that question.
We don't have a cat.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
What denominations would you like that in?
Clean up the kitchen.
You have the wrong number.
They began to climb the hill.
I'm not lonely.
I just want to know why you brought me here.
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
I had to go back.
I was going to write to you, but I started doing other things and forgot.
Why would anyone want to kill me?
You can't be thirty years old.
You're a very good football player.
Let him in.
I don't think anyone noticed what we did.
I have to borrow some money.
No one cheated.
Tom is a bit strange.
You're probably tired.
It's a nice day and I feel like taking a walk.
He stopped talking to them.
Tom pretended to be Canadian.
He told me about it in private.
This bag cost me 6 pounds.
He went to school only for a few years.
Are all these books yours?
Tom is asleep on the couch.
I just really need some time alone.
It's a sunny day.
I'm a smart man.
You look a little pale.
I'm sorry if my words hurt you.
You are curious, aren't you?
The job is half done.
That's an excellent suggestion.
This cookbook has recipes for every imaginable occasion.
I don't have as much money as you think.
Haven't you eaten lunch?
I wrote a letter in French.
I think maybe Tom was right.
I'll be busy all next week.
I know who asked you here.
That's close enough.
You can't imagine doing that, can you?
He faced toward the sea.
I'm not giving you any more money.
I was drinking tea all morning.
I talked to her.
I ordered a pizza.
Do you know Tom?
Can you please tell me your name once more?
Do you think the Supersonics will go all the way to the world championships?
What is the most popular movie now?
I love being around him.
Don't tease me.
Termites are destroying the houses.
I want another cup of coffee.
Tom wouldn't say yes.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
I need to take care of my kids.
I retired in 2013.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
He calls her up every night.
He speaks English fluently.
You're very astute.
I like that song.
You shouldn't be in here.
Just get to work.
They agreed to start early.
He gets hives when he eats eggs.
None of us want that.
It's stuffy in here.
Are you home?
Have you got a match?
Where is your money?
Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
I'm not young.
I was pleasantly surprised.
She likes sleeping.
What's your friend's name?
With great power comes great responsibility.
You just screwed up.
Let us do the work.
We are going to climb that mountain.
Thank you for your understanding.
This might be the last time we ever see each other.
I don't know when he'll come.
They gathered at the coffee shop for a meeting.
Many weeds were growing among the flowers.
Can you recommend a place to stay in London?
Come and see me once in a while.
I'm shooting.
I'm glad you're here with me.
I'm not ashamed.
It's missing.
Somebody laughed.
Why are you with me?
We didn't hear you come in.
I find you irresistible.
She saw him at the station.
This is all that's left.
Let's get back to work.
They lost again.
Let's work together on this.
We're nearly there.
I feel funny.
This guy's tough.
You're not easy to find.
Why wouldn't you let me go to Tom's party?
Tom never came back.
Tom contradicted himself.
I asked my son what he really wanted.
Tom said he hoped he'd be able to help us.
What activity do you spend most of your time doing?
You may come in now.
Tom is not able to drive a car.
She hurt her foot when she fell off her bicycle.
It was not until yesterday that we knew about it.
Whoever gets home first starts cooking the supper.
I'm good at singing.
Your conduct is absolutely shameful.
I have no idea why he quit his job suddenly.
My girlfriend is crying.
You may disagree with me.
The air we breathe consists of oxygen and nitrogen.
What would your father think?
We can solve this problem easily.
That was really bad.
You can't buy this medicine without a prescription.
That's not my concern.
You must know Tom pretty well.
Is it always wrong to take a human life?
It seems logical to me.
He's an excellent kisser.
You should do something you enjoy doing.
He has a rich imagination.
That's all for today.
He gave me his phone number.
Tom isn't doing it the right way.
What time does your watch say it is now?
They admired the lovely scenery.
We're out of wine.
Take it easy.
Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
They deceived us.
Many people think that children don't spend enough time playing outside.
I've got to do my chores.
The dangers are obvious.
I can't stand the noise.
I'd like to set things straight.
Life is boring in a small village.
Take it easy!
Am I correct?
I haven't told the kids yet that we're getting divorced.
What's the longest word in French?
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Tell the truth to Tom.
The old man tripped over his own feet.
That one is all yours.
Tom is very angry.
You look European.
I've found a good job.
That's lovely.
He was nearly drowned.
We don't have to do this.
I'll never forgive you as long as I live.
Above all, you must help each other.
You're the greatest.
Draw a line from A to B.
Is there something you want to ask me?
Having lived in Tokyo, I know the city well.
It was no trouble.
Mary made her own wedding dress.
He may change his mind later.
Be polite to your parents.
He left the box unprotected.
Remember these rules.
Take a shower.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
We must do it again.
That guy still doesn't know who I am.
Let's go somewhere quiet so we can talk.
Don't stop until I tell you.
Gradually the interest rate will increase.
My wife and I are expecting our first child.
Tough luck!
We can't do it now.
Are you for or against his idea?
I love this game.
Did you get my gift?
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
Cross out all the wrong answers.
The rumor that they would get married spread at once.
He is quite right.
The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in the year 1806.
She married him last year.
The weather today is worse than yesterday.
He laid his head on the pillow.
We must keep a diary every day.
You're stubborn.
I was watching television when the telephone rang.
They've lost so much.
I had to stay.
Tom made no comment.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
How did you come by all this money?
I think we're already too late.
That's all Tom has to say.
I think you need some sleep.
He will be a good teacher.
Is it made of wood or metal?
True happiness consists of desiring little.
Can I touch it?
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
Tom often stays up all night.
Let's do it!
I didn't even know you spoke French.
I can't tell you what you want to hear.
I heard coughing.
I didn't know what to do first.
When did you come back from London?
I had a good time during the trip.
There is no escape.
It's an investment.
I finally found time to sit down and read the newspaper.
You can't do this to us.
I may die tomorrow.
He parties too much.
There are a lot of beautiful songs on these records.
Just do your job.
They can't do that.
I woke you up.
That chicken hasn't laid any eggs lately.
It doesn't ring a bell.
How can I get to the police station?
The American ships were stopped and searched in British waters.
I can't come now.
I knew it was a lie.
I admire you.
Have a look.
She will give a party next week.
The delay forced us to stay overnight in an expensive hotel.
My daughter has braces.
Is your trunk locked?
I don't know why Tom's looking for Mary.
I have a daughter.
We thought you could do it.
It's unlikely that our team will win.
Don't touch me, you pig!
Don't be so shy.
How did you enjoy the movie?
Tom is eating breakfast right now.
This train is made up of seven cars.
It's working as intended.
I've never even told my husband.
The car ran into a tree.
The paper is white.
What else can you do?
How long will that be?
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Would you sing for me?
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
The police have been searching for the stolen goods for almost a month.
I can't stop my nosebleed.
How does it work?
Have you lost your ticket?
He dashed out of the store.
The country's economy is about to collapse.
Could you describe to the jury what happened?
I'm nervous.
Copy this program on your computer.
You're very astute.
You've got your permit, right?
The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
Tom doesn't like baseball very much.
Let's meet on Sunday.
That's evident.
It is a pity that he can't come.
I don't think we should buy this.
I'd rather do this by myself.
His grades have improved significantly.
You'll have to stand on your toes to see.
The teacher got well again.
I didn't think anything was suspicious.
I am right.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen.
The old man sat down.
Let me help you with that.
I heard you don't eat meat.
Tom's behavior never ceases to surprise me.
Hey, what happened?
I fell in love with her at first sight.
Maybe we can fix this.
You're elusive.
It happend completely by accident.
I can't wait to go.
I didn't like the result.
The meeting was held here.
You shouldn't have said that.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
I can't tell you what you want to hear.
The bigger boys torment the little ones.
Tom wiped his feet on the doormat.
You were such a big help yesterday.
We drank all night.
We are looking for a place to stay.
What's your diagnosis?
I beg your pardon?
I don't want your gold.
He never cared much for me.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
I'd take it if I were you.
I want to know where it is.
You're very talented.
I collect postcards.
Now that Tom is unemployed, he has quite a bit of free time.
We saw it on the news.
I bared my soul to her.
I'm doing all I can.
I'll let you get back to work.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
I can't believe he kissed you.
Is the dog chained?
I'm optimistic.
I don't want to be in pain.
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.
It has been raining since yesterday.
He sat there surrounded by his children.
I want a room with a view.
The dog was sleeping on the mat.
They regarded the man as a danger to society.
There have been a lot of airplane accidents recently.
I don't want to take on any more work.
Give Tom some water.
You need to be more patient.
Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?
That's pretty much all you need to know.
Tom lied to you, didn't he?
Don't forget that we have homework.
Tom certainly drives a nice car.
We missed our train.
My brother is an idiot.
I never thought about it.
May I suggest another strategy?
You could hear a pin drop.
You just don't get it, do you?
Tom was talking to Mary.
Here's the bill.
We were terrified.
Judging from his appearance, he must be a rich man.
She gave me a large room while I stayed at her house.
Sorry I didn't reply sooner.
I want you to remember this moment.
You're very flexible.
I have no explanation.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I'm late for practice.
Let's find a way to do that.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
Can you excuse me a second?
You have to see it.
It must have slipped my mind.
I admire your confidence.
He's skilled at videogames.
He deals in hardware.
The apples he sent to me were delicious.
Everyone in my family is happy.
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
I could tell you who did it.
The summer is over.
Doing that will only make things worse.
It'll take some time to finish unloading the truck.
How's the weather in New York?
It must've been very difficult for Tom.
I usually wake up at six o'clock.
What did you make?
You can read this book.
I never thought I would have to support such a large family.
Why wouldn't you go out with him?
You're the only one who can help me.
You don't want to point that gun at me.
He washes the car every week.
I'm all yours.
I thought it over and decided not to go.
How embarrassing!
He is impatient to see you.
Man cannot live without air.
He went over to the other side.
Tell the truth to Tom.
I'd be honored.
What I did was wrong.
Can you give us your point of view?
I have to leave now.
Give me back my hat.
You're opportunistic.
What's your secret?
They're not happy.
I don't kiss and tell.
You should relax a little.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
How long did you stay at the party?
I still haven't decided yet.
What does this have to do with our current problems?
We must act.
What is your earliest memory from childhood?
The office where my father works is near the station.
They're not so bad.
Are you dating anyone?
Maybe Tom is stupid.
No one is coming.
Have you seen the dog? He wandered off a couple of minutes ago.
Tom refused to sign the document.
I thought you'd never call.
I know it doesn't look like it, but I've actually gotten rid of a lot of stuff out of the spare room.
Fasten your seat belt.
Do you know how many there are?
She laid herself on the grass.
It's this book.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
I've got a bad memory for names.
Do what you have to do.
He's not married.
Don't you think it went great?
Tom isn't a hero.
I can't stand it any longer.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I remember mentioning it once or twice.
I have a week to do my homework.
What does this word mean?
That was why he entered the university.
I had no doubts.
I'll give you back the money tomorrow.
You're a prude.
I think that's enough for now.
Why are you all here?
I'd like to go to the zoo.
Be more flexible.
I want to study history.
I'm very sleepy today, too.
The radio was invented by Marconi.
I want a boyfriend.
He lives in the next town.
You're not dead yet.
I didn't think that you could do that.
I read at least one book every month.
How thin is too thin?
Don't make any loud noises.
She came to like the new teacher.
After we finish digging the trench, planting the flowers will be easy.
He walked away with a sad look on his face.
Speak into the microphone.
He dropped in on me.
They all have kids.
Fill out the questionnaire.
How many times a day do you eat?
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
Everyone, follow me.
Are they tall?
I hope you're happy.
Our conversation was interrupted by his sneezes.
Have you lost your mind?
Do you think I'm fat?
I'll wait outside.
They're small.
She cremated him against his wishes.
We do not accept tips.
Tom spent a lot of time in Boston in 2013.
I know you considered me a close friend.
We happened to take the same train.
I thought you might feel the same way.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
Go over the choices again.
You're off the hook.
It doesn't matter how small it is.
I knew you would do something great.
Did you see anyone suspicious?
Hold down the fort while I'm gone.
You'd better leave now.
English is spoken in many countries around the world.
I don't think I'd mind eating Chinese food every day.
I need to lose a few pounds.
He's not smart enough to add numbers in his head.
Our guest is waiting for us downstairs.
She ran for the door.
Tom was late for work.
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
While you are asleep, the bodily functions slow down and body temperature falls.
I want to send this by registered mail.
You may change your mind.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
He feels hurt.
He lives somewhere about here.
This is cheap.
Tom must've been imagining things.
I saw Yoshida for the first time in five years.
You don't look Japanese.
He owes his wealth to good luck.
That's very kind of you.
There is nothing more important than friends.
It's the dynamic interaction between the characters that makes this novel so great.
Get some sleep, okay?
We fixed the price at $15.
Tom made good money on that deal.
My French is actually not so good.
I want a match. Do you have one?
Grab this.
You're the first person I told that to.
I will help.
Why are you all sad?
Why don't you take a nap?
I have a book in my hand.
Some people think that it is difficult for a native speaker of English to learn Chinese, but I disagree.
The police suspected there was a connection between the abandoned car and the dead body found three miles away.
His sisters are both beautiful.
Don't do something stupid.
Tell Tom that I need his help.
I want to give you the chance to do that.
I just don't want to go with you.
The instant he opened the door, he smelt something burning.
Write to him right away.
I want to know about you.
The boy is very honest.
Where's my microphone?
You're a liar.
This sounds very interesting.
I'm trying to save Tom's life.
She wasn't dancing with him then.
He was a fresh face in American politics.
I'm a little bit hungry.
I grow many kinds of roses.
If it were not for water, there would be no life on the earth.
My life was a wreck.
How often do you feed the fish?
The box was empty.
I want to know what you think.
Tom entered his password.
These boxes are heavy.
He works with me at the office.
The senator was censured by the congressional ethics committee.
I just want to make it up to you.
Monopolies are bad.
Have you eaten anywhere interesting lately?
I'm just a poor student.
We promised.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
There's a cat in my house.
I have a proposal.
Be prepared.
I can do it now.
Do you want something to eat?
Your comments made Tom laugh.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
I'm not going to disappear.
She feels at ease in their home.
How many more forks do we need?
I appreciate you coming here.
My father has gone to China. He isn't here now.
They were both drunk.
You're no fun.
At seventy, my father is still very active.
I hate reptiles.
We're up early.
How much thinner do you want to be?
I'd love to go there one day.
You don't seem so busy.
He touched my shoulder.
I don't have a cent.
Why are you wearing those?
I hope you won't mind.
The tsunami alert was cancelled.
I'll look after that child.
She lives next door to him.
Please wait here.
I didn't feel well.
I have to admit I'm interested.
I eat a lot.
You don't know German, do you?
It was cheaper than I had thought it would be.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I looked at the calendar on the wall.
They don't understand French.
I don't like this one.
I read the letter to him.
I'm a doctor.
You can go to the station by bus.
I'm looking for an easy-to-read manga with furigana.
Was his story true?
Tom wanted to see Mary's room.
Many Japanese get married in church.
Everything is broken.
They tried to cheer me up.
I know almost nothing about it.
They did a good job.
This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it.
That's the best thing that could happen to me.
I can't change these plans.
I'd like to pay you back.
Drunken driving is a serious problem.
Be prepared.
Do you have a problem?
World War II ended in 1945.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
Why don't you drop around sometime?
My mother is not always at home.
Does that make you sad?
I want to watch.
He was spotted stealing cookies.
Can you help me when I move?
This doctor is a man of culture.
Are we done?
I am glad to help you.
It keeps you on your toes.
Things didn't go as planned.
We have snow in January.
It's hard for me to express ideas through words.
She is skipping rope.
I wanted your opinion.
The teacher asked me a difficult question.
Tom sat on the window sill.
Tom had no other choice but to help Mary clean out the garage.
I'm not happy about it.
I didn't hear it.
Her son is a genius.
I appreciate you calling me.
He has enough ability to manage a business.
In autumn the leaves turn yellow.
How are you feeling tonight?
I wish I had your job.
There are holes in the roof.
The baby wants its mother.
He deserves the prize.
Is she married?
The official could not deal with the complaint himself.
We stayed at the Dorchester.
Shall I begin?
Tom doesn't even have a pencil.
Control yourself.
It's an old pain.
Where ever did you buy it?
The criminals have all been apprehended.
There was a winner.
Our country's climate is temperate.
Call us when you get there.
Tom's father is in jail.
Where are my books?
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
I've never seen one like that.
He had the courage to expose the scandal.
I led that mission.
We're not throwing it away.
Where is Boston?
A young man barged in unexpectedly.
Which hat do you want to buy?
What did you decide?
I was afraid I'd never see you again.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Tom died suddenly of a stroke.
Let's call the whole thing off.
Can you think of any reason why that might be the case?
I like Japanese food.
Who's going to drive?
I need a pair of scissors to cut this paper.
Thanks to his help, I finished my homework.
Tom stole it.
Why are you so hard-headed?
Do you understand how serious this is?
I need to get a haircut.
I speak from experience.
I try to keep a low profile.
Who does this belong to?
They grow flowers in the garden.
It is time to shut the gate.
I read in the newspaper recently that the crops really need rain.
I heard someone call my name.
He made a lot of money.
Who told you the news?
It's normal for you to feel a bit woozy.
This word has two meanings.
I'd rather stay home than go fishing.
I like listening to Tom.
You're the oldest.
If you're not happy, quit.
That should be enough.
Please be careful.
Why don't you stop worrying and get some sleep?
My school has a band.
He told me an interesting story.
That day shall come.
I tried calling, but they didn't answer.
The children were so noisy that I couldn't study.
It would be a good idea if I went.
It is windy today.
We communicated with each other by gesture.
How did this happen?
Have you fed the dog?
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
She eats lunch here from time to time.
They're going to make mistakes.
We need a victory.
I'm sure that I'll win that tennis match.
That's stupid.
You might get something in the mail today.
Are you sure that's safe?
I built this for you.
I think you shouldn't be doing that.
She gave me the evil eye.
Cookie is my dog.
He gives me a bad time, as he always does.
What do you like about her?
It seems that the store is closed today.
Tom heard someone humming his favorite tune.
May I ask why?
Does she have a boyfriend?
Are you better now?
You'd better do what Tom says.
My father doesn't drink so much sake.
Tom's big-headed.
Tom said you were lonely.
He has a beautiful tan.
He left Japan for good.
I hope you will be completely cured.
Give me something to write on.
Lay it on the table.
Don't forget to put on sunscreen.
Tom wanted to be a farmer.
I want to have a part-time job, too.
How long will you stay in Japan?
He focused on his studies.
He's the king's most trusted advisor.
It's way too heavy.
The chimney is belching black smoke.
Has your dog ever bitten you?
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
Do you want anything to eat?
It doesn't look too hard.
I used to have a dog.
She is as beautiful as ever.
My father is at home.
I didn't see your car outside.
Has Tom always been fat?
It was bitterly cold outside.
The law has been changed.
I folded all the towels.
Tom fixed everything.
May I borrow your lawnmower?
What is it with you people?
There is no cure for schizophrenia.
Don't even get me started.
It's a huge responsibility.
Apart from on rainy days, I always ride my bike to work.
Could I do it?
I didn't think I was going to win.
I am married and I have two sons.
Please sit still.
Is it not black?
The stock market was surprisingly quiet today.
All the doors of the house were closed.
Did you find everything you want?
I couldn't tell her from sister.
I can't change how tall I am.
I met her at the station by accident.
He used the dictionary.
This plan is fool-proof.
I just want to make sure we all agree.
Who's your favorite lyricist?
I know you are rich.
Don't drink the water.
I freaked out.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
Participants in a seance try to contact the dead.
Scorpions are dangerous.
Turn toward me, please.
Was there a scandal?
You don't seem too happy to see me.
The cat is playing with the children.
I had loads of fun.
Are you enjoying yourself?
The student made an irrelevant remark.
None of this makes sense.
That's your half.
You may enter now.
I don't know what this word means. I'll look it up in the dictionary.
Tell me what really happened.
I know you're busy, but I could use some help.
I am terribly afraid of snakes.
They all cheered.
Won't you go shopping with me?
You've misspelled my name.
He did his best to carry out the plan.
Don't lie. Be honest.
We should wait.
Put your pants on.
I didn't know what it meant.
Can't you do something to help me?
I can understand that.
You can get a lot of bang for your buck at this store.
I haven't given up yet.
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
You can say whatever you want to.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
She went out without saying a word.
No one is amused.
Maybe you should turn off the television and do something else.
I don't want to play.
Are you children all right?
It is no good to you.
I just want some souvenirs to remember this place by.
You're a nervous wreck.
Some men shave their legs.
Tom doesn't know who I am.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
You must be very special.
I went to the mall with my friends.
Men are all the same.
I don't feel so great.
He has a sweet voice.
Where did you see those women?
He traveled by boat.
Subtlety never was your strong suit.
We know all about that.
I've got to get back to work.
I hear you were grounded.
It was a good day.
This newspaper article is more interesting than the previous one.
I regret not having listened.
He is very afraid of dogs.
Once you've formed a bad habit, you can't get rid of it easily.
I was very proud of that.
Nobody will say it so bluntly, but that is the gist of it.
Please come here.
She asked me to come to her bedside.
Unemployment is high.
We learned French.
The trouble with you is that you talk too much.
Let me pay for it.
I'm used to staying up late.
What's the purpose of your visit?
I don't feel like doing it today.
The worst is probably over.
I had to call off the party.
They ate up all the cake.
I live in Boston.
You should have kept it secret.
She has no more than 100 dollars.
They went into the woods for a picnic.
I'm not hungry anyway.
He is sitting cross-legged.
He is likely to win the game.
He is no friend of mine.
I like women.
Did I ask you?
I want something to write on.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
That's not the point.
I can't decide if I'm happy or sad.
I want you to help me clean it up.
This form looks kind of complicated. Help me fill it out.
I don't have a bicycle.
Can I get you something?
I am terribly hungry.
I want to see what I'm up against.
I'm looking for your sister. Where is she?
He was not sure what to do.
Tom has betrayed me.
These are our books.
He was sick, so he did not go out.
This tastes pretty good to me.
I haven't gotten paid yet.
Several students were absent from school because of colds.
He would not go out.
We saw you.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
You lied to us, didn't you?
She informed me of her departure.
This steak is too tough.
I didn't know what to say to her.
I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice.
It's lost.
There isn't room for everyone.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
What cold drinks do you have?
I read your report.
I was able to help her.
Would you like a glass of water?
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
We need to make sure that this is true.
I'm in my underwear.
Would you kindly make room for this old woman?
Don't forget your sunscreen.
Thanks for bringing me here.
It's not the first time.
Tom is staying.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
This is what you're supposed to do.
Are you honest?
It's impossible to anticipate every possible situation.
Did you plan it yourself?
She stayed there for a short while.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
There is a television in my room.
What exactly did you say?
My girlfriend is crying.
Put more salt in the soup.
Tom kissed Mary.
I want you to sit with me.
It's perfectly legal.
Don't push me!
He sat down beside her.
Aim. Fire!
Tom is a very good friend.
I thought we were best friends.
What is the local time in New York?
I stopped smoking.
You'll have to learn all these dates by rote.
The CIA runs a thorough background check on all new employees.
Tom was wearing a bulletproof vest, so the bullet didn't kill him.
After that, he went home.
I love you for who you are.
What could I do?
He plays the piano well.
I used to respect you.
That can't be good for you.
I wasn't sure about that.
Do you want wine?
No other student in the class is as brilliant as he is.
Each of us has to be careful when driving.
This bed looks solid.
I'll go and get your coat.
It's too small.
"How about a cup of coffee?" "I'd like to, but I have a previous engagement."
An athlete must keep in good condition.
I made a deposit in the bank yesterday.
You're my boss.
Can you repair this?
Leave out this word.
How many boys are there in your class?
All of us looked through the window.
Which one of those is yours?
Are you going to sing here?
Tom is quite different.
I had no choice but to do what he asked.
What time is dinner?
Who gave you this envelope?
Your question has no answer.
Coffee will be served after the meal.
I wish you luck.
She was about to leave.
We have a mutual friend.
I'm catching on.
The door remained closed.
There was a lot of blood on the floor.
Why are you worrying about something that doesn't matter so much?
He wanted it to be a surprise.
We all got distracted.
Why did you name your dog Cookie?
Let's take a ten-minute break.
I pretended that I was sleeping.
It won't be long before they get married.
You're a wonderful friend.
I have drunk all my milk.
You're not tired, are you?
Tom thinks that's not a good idea.
Would you like to see that again?
I did smoke when I was young.
I had the exact same feeling.
I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt you.
Do you have something to show me?
I thank you for your honesty.
How are we feeling today?

What did Tom build?
I wish I had known about this when I was a kid.
We all work.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Tom doesn't like me.
Try not to cry.

I made myself a cup of hot chocolate.
He's young and attractive.
I had my hair cut at the barber shop yesterday.
Those flowers are beautiful.
Could you give me a discount?
What is wrong with you people?
That's not important now.
We're shocked.
Everything in this store is overpriced.
I knew you couldn't do it.
Let's have a contest. The side to come up with the worst insult wins.
How can you say that?
I'd like to have dinner with you sometime.
I had my bicycle stolen.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.
There were hundreds of people milling about in the streets.
I love chocolate.
How many books do you think you have read so far?

You gotta get more organized.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
Where do you plan to go on vacation next summer?
I just wanted to say thank you.

Let's be happy.
She made me hurry.
Previously people believed the earth was flat.
I couldn't care less.
How come you didn't call me last night?
He tried getting close to her using every means possible.
This tree is older than that car.
I really miss you.
Excuse me, but would you please tell me the way to the post office?
Please give me that book.
Adjust your tie.
This bad weather is more than I bargained for.
I want you both to get them.
You've got to hide.
Mother bought me the book.
I thought Tom had a meeting this afternoon.
You don't have enough experience.
She plays tennis after school.
Why did you marry him?
How much does this umbrella cost?
Do you want me to leave?
What time does the first train leave?

Close the window before going to bed.
Why is this knife not in the drawer?
Didn't you read the manual?

I'm happy that it's over.
You're a jolly good feller.
The meeting finished at nine.
What station is it?

I'll believe that when I see it.
I'm a married man now.
I'll see you at nine tomorrow morning.
Have you finished reading the book I lent you last week?
She has a very good voice.
I can't believe this is happening.

Why were you laughing?
I just got a call from the police.

I was married at that time.
Tom's injuries aren't considered life-threatening.
Six people applied for the job, but none of them were employed.

We have a lot to learn from each other.
Is there something you wanted to say?
He failed to become a cabinet member at that time.

What does that mean?
I keep having this dream about drowning.
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
Where's your weapon?

I'll be at home in the morning.
Everything is on schedule.
Do you have a fishing license?
Keep mum about this plan.

I need to go shopping.
Why did you buy it?
I want to be able to speak French like a native speaker.
Can you still remember when we first met?
Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
I really wish you wouldn't do that.
Where are the apples?
How did you manage to do that?
Be quiet. If you aren't quiet, you'll be thrown out.

When would it be convenient for you?
You're talkative.

Do you have any children?
Tom looks lost and confused.
Don't disappear on me again.
I was afraid of what people would think.
Can you promise me you won't tell Tom?
He died of old age two years ago.
I'm just making a suggestion.
You understand me very well.
It reminds me of the good old times.
We haven't lost much.
Mary is helping her mother.
Is there a washing machine in the house?
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Don't you want to ask me what I want?
I need to finish my homework.
Why is he asking me that question?
We can do so much more.
I had to pay 5 dollars in addition.
May I have this dance?

What is it you want to sell to us?
You read too much.
Are you excited?
What are you punishing them for?

What's the real reason you're here?

That boy won't tell me his name.
Did you see what Tom just did?
Would you like to hear the parrot talk?
Let me help you put on your coat.
I can't stay for long.
This isn't what I asked for.
It looks like a duck.
He had no coat on.
I've always wanted to learn to cook like you.

Can you put up with the way he behaves?
I put it here somewhere.
He is my husband's best friend.
Is there anyone in here?
Do you really think we can win?

Our class is a small one.
I got you confused with your oldest brother.
Give it to me!
Tom doesn't agree with you.
Shall we go and eat?
I want a room with two beds.
There's no urgency.
Sign this.
The agenda for the meeting has been distributed.
Did you also invite your friends?
I don't think this is for you.

Come on! We'll be late.

I think it's time for me to start cooking dinner.
Do you feel lucky?
There's no entertainment for young people around here.

Is that good enough?

I don't believe that either.
Stop worrying about that.
Why don't you do that by yourself?
The boy made a paper plane.
Tom said he'd call at 2:30.
Tom changed jobs.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
He threw in the towel.
More than half the residents are opposed to the plan.
May I come again?
I finally feel like everything's going my way.
It's up to you.
I was wrong.
I have the feeling you had something else in mind.
How much does that cost?
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
I telephoned her at once.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
I will go if you go.

Learn Italian.
You're right, I think.
I'll give him a pen.
Tom's gun is missing.
It was a bitter pill to swallow.

Tell Tom that I'm too tired to help him.
Have you seen all these movies?
I came in through the window.
Children need a lot of sleep.
You are good.
Whose book is this?
Have you already finished?
He has a big mouth.
Unfortunately, I'll have to pass.
The train stopped because of the storm.
Could I use your phone?
I owe what I am to my father.
She asked him some questions, but he refused to answer.
Please telephone me before you come.
There's still plenty that needs to be done.
He gave up his attempt once and for all.
He was educated by his grandfather.
Everyone sat down.
I stopped laughing.
I began living by myself.
Nobody was listening to us.
Tom hates homework.
I went home to change my clothes.
Do you think you would ever consider going out with me?
I'm giving you what you want.
I want a dozen cream puffs.
You sound tired.
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
I came here to save you.
I don't care how long the list is.
That's alright.
Is that thing working?
I think what Tom is doing is amazing.
I'm the bad one.
Tom tried to run away.
Who are you trying to convince?
He exchanged his old car for a new one.
I'll give you a ride home.
Are you really going to do that?
I want you to get started right away.

I was very flattered.
You'll have to take his place in case he can't come.
I'm going to miss you, too.
Tom often goes shopping alone.
The garage is dusty.
We were friends.
Don't think about stuff like that.
Tell Tom where he should go.
I've been saving up to buy a new saxophone.
I believe you know what I mean.
My father can speak English well.
She pressed her nose against the glass.
We stayed at the Dorchester.
He reminds me of his father when he speaks.
She's very afraid of snakes.
I'll guide you.
Tom loved his kids.
I owe you a dinner.
It sounds good to me.
No tickets are needed.
Somebody laughed.
I'm proud to have him as a friend.
I'm going to lock the door.
I had no friends except for Tom.
He was mad at me because I broke up with him.
I broke up with her.
It's pathetic.
That's a doll.
Tom is too young for that.
Do you sometimes study in the library?
Are you jealous?
It is good for your health to take a walk every morning.
I can't believe I was so stupid.
What happened to your voice?
Never mind what she says.
Come and keep me company.
I can't sing.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
The circumstances were different then.
Why would Tom be here?
He took a deep breath before entering his boss's office.
I want to travel by airplane.
We should always obey laws.
She made up her mind to graduate from high school.
All of us live in the same dorm.
This road goes to the park.
It wasn't Tom's idea. It was mine.
We left home early in the morning.
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
She laced her shoes.
Are they worth it?
What's going to happen?
My parents aren't going to be there.
Children are sometimes afraid of the dark.
Do they like wine?
Are you sure that it was Tom?
I can't remember his name.
This word is derived from Latin.
No one thinks so.
They were free at that moment.
The Japan Sea separates Japan from the Asian Continent.
Will it be fine tomorrow?
What do you need a doctor for?
You were terrified, weren't you?
People have to obey the rules.
His explanation was not satisfactory.
Are you leaving now?
He got through with his work.
Don't be afraid of seeing the doctor.
I'll get ice.
I relaxed.
We'd be very interested in what you think.
They did not want to spend much time talking about it.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
I think we may have a problem.
I have been looking for you.
I know I'm not the brightest girl in the world.
I trust him.
I fell down the stairs.
Open up.
Tom disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer.
Tell us a little about yourself.
What were the meetings like?
No one can hear us.
We'll be back after this short break.
I can't believe I missed this before.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
Tom didn't want this to happen.
I'll always be here for you.
Do you like oysters?
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I am just a nobody.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
Are you famous?
I'll work alone.
Ignore Tom's request.
Am I really the only one here who doesn't understand French?
I'm not fighting.
I suggest you go west.
You're not angry, are you?
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
You'd better relax a bit.
I'm sorry, my father is out.
When did I ever hurt you?
Why are you asking so many questions?
He is very slow at making friends with anybody.
Do you have any aspirin on you?
No one made you do anything.
Many lives were lost.
I went to the hospital.
I'm moving, so I need boxes for my things.
I'm not like you.
I'm fine with it.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
Can you tell me where I am on this map?
Help me pick out a tie to go with this suit.
Trade between two countries can be complex.
No one could deny this.
Speak slowly, please.
Why did you want to speak with us?
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
If you keep trying, you will make progress.
You might not find it.
I often catch colds in the winter.
You don't have to apologize.
I have a few minutes to spare.
I lived in Australia for three years.
He is proud of being a musician.
I couldn't let you do that.
Coffee is Brazil's main product.
Don't you think that Tom was a little weird?
Do you enjoy losing?
He has been living in Ankara for six years.

You don't work here.
I have an older brother and an older sister.
Let me get that for you.
Would you put out the candles?
The leaves are turning red.
Don't take any prisoners.
He told us a very exciting adventure story.
How will we pay our debts?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Quakers believe that all people are equal.
No one lives here anymore.
Where do I sleep?
How much rent do you pay for the apartment?
That shouldn't be hard for you.
I will never forget seeing you.
Wait here for a while.
Thank you for making it so easy.
We're half right.
I have two questions for you.
Words can't describe it.
The door is closing.
I hardly ever go to museums.
She has buried her only son.
I know I'm in trouble now.
I'm sorry about last night.
You can open your eyes now.
They know we're cops.
The museum is closed now.
Tom helped his mother decorate the Christmas tree.
We can't just leave Tom here by himself.
What kinds of changes are needed to address these problems?
He was invited.
He grew up in a small town.
I lay on my bed.
He doesn't believe me at all.
I will help you.
Are you seriously ill?
She grabbed a shower.
There was no bathroom.
The tree stopped growing.
I can't do this job without you.
Finally, we arrived in England.
I was in the hospital a few days ago.
They camped on the beach.
I can open the window.
It has never been done before.
I'm really disappointed.
The cost of living in the United States was rising.
I'm hiding.
Tom is checking his messages on his phone.
It happened in Rome.
Don't you just love it here?
They were both drunk.
He must be homesick.
I want you to be prepared.
I'm not your enemy.
You should be proud of yourself.
This is impossible for me.
Luckily, Tom had some money I could borrow.
I give you everything you ask for, but you never seem satisfied.
I pretended that it didn't bother me.
Dry your eyes.
I just don't understand what goes through the minds of people who troll forums.
I didn't eat dinner last night.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
You're not as smart as me.
He's old and ugly.
How could anybody not like this?
I was invited to their wedding.
Give me a glass of water.
This isn't mine.
I would like a word with you.
I know what you were doing.
Recently, many people are finding it hard to make a decent living.
Tom left his sunglasses in his car.
We are watching.
She danced with him at the high school prom.
You should not have done that. It was wrong.
It's 8:30.
Why do you want to commit suicide?
Try to open the door.
What do you think they're after?
I didn't read the whole thing.
"Thanks." "You're welcome."
She thanked him for all his help.
For me, time is not money.
I can't be bothered to go out tonight.
We're out of bullets.
He smiled and said goodbye.
Finding a good place to live isn't easy.
This just might come in handy someday.
Tom's leg was badly burned.
I won't do that unless you want me to.
This is what'll happen.
We didn't recognize each other.
Do you have any books in French?
What time is it?
Can I take your picture?
We've been asked to not do this anymore.
We had no customers, so we shut the shop early.
You have a beautiful apartment.
I cannot lend this book to you.
The child is suffering from the heat.
Don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
The girl and her parents were very sympathetic.
Are you religious?
You may go there.
Can I eat that?
I know you want to talk to Tom.
Just ignore her.
I do not know any of them.
Say hello to your friends.
I work in a hospital.
One out of 455 women doesn't realize she's pregnant until the twentieth week of pregnancy.
Tom left his keys on the table.
There are plenty of nice girls out there.
Home prices are surging.
I love this town.
I considered not going.
She never stops complaining.
Tom knows why nobody came to his party.
Women don't drive as well as men.
Can I talk to you about your son?
She writes with her left hand.
Watch my back.
I thought he was an American but he turned out to be an Englishman.
He's sketching an apple.
I'm thorough.
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
I have a pen.
Her mother lives in the country all by herself.
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
I am an optimist by nature.
She advised him to exercise.
Are you religious?
That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?
I've got to get ready for school.
I have failed.
Our bike tour of the French Alps lasted two weeks.
I know I could've done that, but I didn't.
Tom dreams of becoming a millionaire.
I was talking about something else.
Did you have fun last night?
Tom said that's just not true.
Don't judge me too harshly.
We want you to take it.
They had an argument.
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
I'm absolutely certain of it.
I have two sons and two daughters.
I don't want to leave Tom.
We must not forget our promise.
He is acquainted with my wife.
No pain, no gain!
I can help you out.
What do you feed your dog?
Nobody backed up what I said.
Is that pure gold?
Let's decide together where to go first.
I didn't fall in love.
The light faded out.
He asked his teacher stupid questions.
Are you looking for us?
I think Tom could make a difference.
Tom and Mary wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.
He stopped the car.
The stripes were horizontal.
She still loved him.
This hurts more than you can imagine.
I asked my boss for a pay raise.
I love you more and more each day.
I wonder how much time we've wasted so far.
Why are we still fighting?
You are not a coward.
Don't you miss your father?
It's none of your business.
It made sense.
Man can't live without dreams.
You have to get up.
We were supposed to help Tom yesterday afternoon.
Did you lose something?
Tom is saving money for a trip to Australia.
Two tickets to San Diego, please.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
She wouldn't let up until I agreed to go to the movies with her.
Can you repeat what you said?
That was only a year ago.
I'm sorry we can't stay any longer.
The boat can still be seen.
Can you see where I'm coming from?
It was rather funny.
Did Tom say how long Mary would be in Boston?
You must pay attention to his advice.
Lay it on the table.
This must be changed.
I think that Tom lied to me.
We're not young.
I promise you I'll never leave you.
Please say hello to your parents for me.
I'll give it my best shot.
I'm getting tired of losing.
Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. Thinking about death clarifies your life.
I had to get away from here.
Could you keep an eye on my suitcase for a few minutes?
I don't know what's going on around here.
I want to examine the body of the victim.
He's your father.
There may be a problem with Tom.
He is not ashamed of his father being poor.
I will stand by you whatever happens.
I'm the type who gets nervous in front of people, so I'm bad at speech making.
This ink stain will not wash out.
I'm the same height as he is.
You didn't eat much lunch, did you?
They're still young.
What on earth are you talking about?
I submitted the application myself.
In due time, his innocence will be proven.
Tom said he was calling from his cell phone.
My uncle lives near the school.
I'm not an expert.
Tom told me to stay at home.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Do you really think it's no good?
Photography is now considered a new form of art.
She emphasized the importance of education.
I read comic books.
I believe Tom can do that.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
They found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.
That's your responsibility.
We want you to take it.
You're so sweet.
I'm very glad that you're here.
You must be blind as a bat if you couldn't see it.
Our patient is regaining consciousness.
I'm ready to go.
You're lucky that you have a job.
You seem busy.
Can you believe this is really happening?
Do they learn English?
He fought until the end.
I don't know how you do that.
I'd like to get rid of all these things.
It looked fresh.
Children depend on their parents for food, clothing and shelter.
Now I understand.
We don't have tea.
She and I have been married 30 years.
How much is this hat?
I've got something to show you.
You must be cautious.
Well, what does that tell you?
The girl treated her horse kindly.
Tom told Mary an interesting story.
It's not pertinent.
Are you relaxed?
Something might fall on you, so be careful.
It's made of leather.
I finished the work yesterday.
Tom is a well-known singer.
We felt sympathy for her.
I've got a cold.
Telephone him if the message is important.
It's better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
He was successful in the attempt.
She asked him to come into her house, but he refused.
Do you think I'm qualified for that job?
The audience clapped loudly after his speech.
She is busy preparing for the trip.
They made sure nobody could see them.
I don't have to worry about my weight.
Where exactly should I put this?
Bodybuilding is his hobby so he has a very firm tight body with lots of muscle definition.
I love you just the way you are.
Let's pray.

Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
I arrived at the stadium at 4:00 p.m., but the game had already started.
I have something.
We are going to have a storm.
I am convinced of your innocence.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
He does well in physics.
I don't know the exact place I was born.
She advised him to come back at once.
Summer is coming to an end.
I can't forget her.
I did that without consulting anyone.
I even wrote a letter to Tom.
He is extremely pessimistic and has no aspirations.
I think that's exciting.
If I had known about it, I would have told you.
Try not to worry.
You can't be too careful in situations like this.
Don't lose your purse.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Are you fully recovered?
He is enrolled at that university.
I didn't do anything illegal.
He remembers to write to her every week.
I paid for it already.
We can't begin the meeting until we have a quorum.
I wish you good luck.
You're so paranoid.
I want you to go home.
I admit he's smart, but does he have to talk over everyone's heads all the time?
I beg you.
I feel like doing something different today.
A cat can see in the dark.
Do you know this man in the picture?
Everybody panicked.
You are wearing your shirt inside out.
To tell the truth, I didn't go there.
This desk is good.
I hope we have better weapons than the enemy does.
That was so cool.
I'll never forget you.
Everybody likes Tom.
They won us over with their small-town hospitality.
I wish I had married your sister instead of you.
I've heard about you.
If for some reason that should happen, what would you do?
It's not a pyramid scheme.
She is a friend of mine.
She is older and wiser now.
Take mine.
It made me very happy.
You don't have to speak so loudly. I can hear you very clearly.
I knew you'd come back sooner or later.
I've only got one left.
Tea with lemon for me, please.
We keep having the same old problem of people not paying their bills on time.
You elect your representative by voting.
I think we can do this without any extra help.
Their lifestyle is different from ours.
Are you free for lunch?
You may take either the big box or the small one.
I thought I heard you.
We still have a long way to go.
We're doing what we want to do.
Which one will he choose?
Do you charge for delivery?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened at school today.
Make an effort.
He is what we call a walking dictionary.
This does not apply to students.
I ran into a tree.
She said that it might be true.
Tom wants people to pity him.
I don't know what you do.
Is that your own idea?
I could never harm you.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
He is to blame for the failure.
We will take care of this for you.
They handled it well.
I don't know what you want to hear.
I know you're hiding something.
What did you do with that car?
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
It was snowing that day.
Where would you like to live?
Who will do it?
Whose friend are you?
He wants these shirts washed.
We all know what happened here.
Onions can be eaten raw or cooked.
I have backstage passes.
You're early.
It was really neat.
I like this color.
Is this the train station?
Please stick out your tongue.
Hey, wait up!
We have captured one of their spies.
Please wait till noon.
The traffic accident deprived the young man of his sight.
They'll kill me.
I've got to do something first.
I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
Don't be late for school again.
Everyone wanted to sing.
How much does the wooden chair cost?
I was caught in the rush hour.
The telephone rang several times.
I'll provide you with all the necessary information.
No one got sick.
Tom comes here about three times a year.
You said you were happy.
I was kept waiting nearly half an hour.
I can't make it.
Tom didn't want to let Mary into his house.
How did it get there?
Cookie is the cutest of all the dogs.
Sing a song with me.
Tom asked Mary for some help.
Do you remember anything from back then?
I don't care about fashion.
We lost no time in sending him to the hospital.
Don't eat my French fries.
She didn't show up.
Be quiet. If you aren't quiet, you'll be thrown out.
In addition to being a famous physicist, he is a great novelist.
My dream is to lead a quiet life in the country.
Wait for Tom.
They're not going to give you this job.
Everyone started clapping.
This decision is final.
We should've brought another bottle of wine.
She makes it a point to always arrive fashionably late.
The first step is the hardest.
That poor family survives on food stamps.
I can't just leave. I have to tell the boss I'm leaving.
This knot will not hold.
Italo Calvino returned to Italy when he was still a child.
They want us to come in right away.
I play piano.
Will you listen to me for a few minutes?
She urged him to study harder.
You're on the path of success.
He is always laughing.
I traveled by myself.
The evening meal is served between 9 and 12.
You probably don't remember me.
Is this your wine?
She has seen better days.
I do my homework after school.
They had no idea what to expect.
I had the same thing happen to me last month.
My wife is always complaining about something.
Can't you help us?
Please don't tell anyone else.
Pardon me for saying so.
May I ask you to help me with something?
I built a shelter.
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
Tom hugged Mary.
What are you working on?
There's a condition.
Do you deliver on Sundays?
Tom is not as fat as I am.
All the children fell asleep before it got dark.
You can't keep me here.
All you do is party.
Whose house is across from yours?
A captain is in charge of his ship and its crew.
I can hardly walk.
There's something I still don't understand.
I hope you two are very happy.
He pushed the emergency button.
Don't you know how dangerous it is to go swimming by yourself?
We're not guilty.
There is often fog in the morning.
I'll wait outside.
I'm as tall as you.
She is good at making up interesting stories.
Her name slipped my mind.
I like your dress.
When I got out of the car, I felt like I had been here before.
I want to take you to dinner.
Don't tell anybody.
Tom got out of the bathtub and dried himself with the new towel that Mary had given him.
I wish you hadn't done that.
I could find his address.
She was hit by a car.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
Don't worry about it!
I never thought it would end like this.
You're a terrible person.
Your effort will surely bear fruit.
I'm too drunk.
Don't be so negative.
I'm very hungry.
Don't worry, I'm going to help you.
It's rare to meet nice people like you.
I have some good news for you.
I like walking by myself.
He is an ideal husband for me.
I don't work on Mondays.
He flatly refused to let me in.
I don't want you to do that, Tom.
It's a no-brainer.
It's fall now.
Might I ask your name?
There is no need for him to work.
Does that mean you bought it?
Few students can read Latin.
I didn't want to spend any more time in jail.
Tom restrained himself from hitting Mary.
I didn't catch what you said.
It becomes warmer day after day.
He accused me of being a liar.
They did what they were told.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
Please turn the television on.
I think we have a lot in common.
Where do you think I met her?
She divorced him.
Driving too fast is dangerous.
How does this work?
I'm sure Tom doesn't do that anymore.
I suffered a lot.
I want to be doing a good job.
Whose handwriting is this?
I called him, but a girl answered the phone.
Is the anesthesiologist there?
The swimmers were numb with cold.
Nobody appreciates me.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
We both competed.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Would you mind if we put this off until tomorrow?
You're good.
Tom won the game.
Tom was real happy.
I kid you not.
You're such an idiot!
I must go out.
I came here to tell you what I found out.
He's hopelessly in love.
Don't lie to me.
You're invited.
She removed the dishes from the table.
Did you know she is good at making coffee?
He should atone for his sins.
I just have to make a call.
We're less than halfway to the top of the mountain. Are you already tired?
It's snowing again.
That's what they all say.
That's about it.
Each of them sang a song.
Tom likes to make paper airplanes.
Please look for it.
Anyone hurt?
You won't need that.
How is your job search going?
My son is going to leave for France next week.
I think that's why Tom is here.
He can't take care of himself.
Tom offered to help Mary move.
I'm not selling you my car.
Come whenever you like.
She was satisfied with the result.
It was exciting.
I can't agree with you.
Wait. I want to show you something.
He is skating.
I had to get a molar extracted.
Tom escaped from his cell.
They were in the right place at the right time.
Are you volunteering to help?
You might at least say "thank you."
Could you put those bags in the car for me?
I think that what you need now is a kiss.
Who's been eating my peanuts?
You've got to be crazy to do something like that.
Where do we know each other from?
I've never been here before.
You sound tired.
But I was careful.
Tom lives in a bad neighborhood.
I'm sorry.
I really wasn't expecting that from you.
Why are you picking a fight with me?
We're up a creek without a paddle.
I learned nothing from the teacher.
We're changing it.
The first season of the year is spring.
What did he do to you?
She looked at a few dresses and picked the most expensive one.
We're not welcome.
Can you beat that?
Have you ever been on TV?
Please call a taxi for me.
Which one of you wasn't on the bus?
She failed every time she tried.
Somehow or other I found his house.
Rabbits breed quickly.
I went to your school.
My mother looks young for her age.
All at once, the Buddhist priest burst into laughter, spoiling the solemn atmosphere.
Are you telling me you're not involved?
I suggest that you take a nap.
We must buy a new carpet for this room.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
There were many things that we wanted to do, but we never got around to doing many of them.
It is always difficult for a son to live up to the expectations of his parents.
I'm trying to clean the house.
Don't you recognize that man?
Bees provide us with honey.
I wish I were rich enough to buy a car like that.
I've got to head back to work.
He's annoying.
She was unconscious for three days.
How did you get those?
You may rely on him.
So what's the problem, exactly?
I started studying French when I was thirteen.
The cat scratched my hand.
Your ideas are all out of date.
We don't have a garden.
You're surrounded.
I'm truthful.
I need to be alone.
What magazines do you subscribe to?
I heard a voice I didn't recognize.
Please note the change in the meeting agenda.
Tom is usually not very reliable.
Show me where it happened.
Stop it. You're making me blush.
Tom sounds angry.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
You can't leave me hanging.
He must finish his homework today.
Don't ask questions, just come with me.
You don't seem to love me anymore.
I'm still waiting for my order.
You can't let it get to you.
How many times did you do that?
I don't see what else we can do.
Just give me what I want.
He wouldn't look at my proposal.
I'm interested in Japanese history.
I suggest we eat just a little now, and then go out later.
Why are they protesting?
Could you not do that here?
There were no clouds today.
I would like to go to Japan.
We never forget.
Getting married is a serious matter.
You're very skeptical.
I hard-boiled an egg.
Your replacement has already been picked.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
We've isolated the problem.
I won't forget that.
Are those for me?
Don't forget to mail this letter.
Tom said that Mary died in her sleep.
We tried our best.
I don't know what we're talking about.
How long were you alone with Tom?
He laid on his back and looked up at the sky.
Tom was poor.
Tom is mad at us.
He denied that he was the thief.
I caught a cold and was in bed yesterday.
You're the most important person in my life.
I cannot stand this noise.
I am very tall.
Go away before they see you here.
Shut off the water.
Hurry, or you'll miss the train.
I love music.
I forgot to lock the storeroom.
I'll call you later.
Put your pants on.
You still have a lot to learn about women.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
She touched him on the shoulder.
Only members of the club are entitled to use this room.
I'm not alarmed.
I give up.
My hair is too long.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
I really think you should leave.
You have no one but yourself to blame.
How about going for a swim?
It's difficult to understand why you want to go.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
How is your last name written?
Okay, I'm ready.
He is my old friend.
Supper is getting cold.
There are plenty of rocks.
He distanced himself from politics.
It doesn't matter.
My father cut wood with a saw.
I'm sure Tom had his reasons.
He was known to everybody in the village.
What do you think might be causing the problem?
I don't think Tom is in Boston.
Tom was beginning to feel ignored.
He cannot have said so.
She must go there.
It is necessary to prepare for the worst.
The teachers greeted the children.
Were you successful?
You shouldn't cancel the meeting.
That's why he got up early.
You do that and I'll fire you.
How are we going to do that?
I was just curious.
There is plenty of water.
I promised I'd tell you the truth.
Hang your coat on the hook.
Don't be upset.
She dumped me.
I have a serious skin problem.
I like to eat apples.
The crowd cried out for an encore.
Give me a second.
They're waiting for you.
Don't make the same mistake again.
He begged me to stay.
Let's start the party.
For all her riches, she's not happy.
We're not sure.
No one knows me like you do.
Can the dentist see me today?
I'm driving.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
I don't believe I can help.
Stop crying like a girl.
It was very windy yesterday.
Would you like to have some tea?
I don't have time to explain it now.
His loss of memory is a psychological problem rather than a physical one.
Ask Tom to explain it.
Promise me you won't do that again.
The chances are slim to none that you'll win the lottery.
What's it called?
In Japan, there is no lake bigger than Lake Biwa.
I don't really want to see you suffer.
Are we allowed to take pictures here?
You don't have to go.
Why didn't she tell me?
Both of them seem suspicious.
You are under no obligation whatsoever to share this information.
This town hasn't changed much in the last ten years.
Let me show you something really awesome.
I applied for membership in the association.
I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper.
He felt himself growing old.
I heard the song sung in French.
She demanded to see the manager.
He gave an excuse about why he had been absent.
That's your duty.
Did they hurt you?
I get the feeling you don't really want me to drive.
May I have the menu, please?
I like your cookies.
He claimed that he had returned the book to the library.
Include me in your plans.
I think it's better not to try it.
I was probably thirty years old at that time.
There's a scratch here. Could you give me a discount?
I love to spend time trying to put together a puzzle.
She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.
Tom is an old friend of mine from high school.
You may need this.
All people can become friends, even if their languages and customs are different.
We're quite alone.
I'm embarrassed.
Take a whiff.
Do you have less expensive ones?
You talk too much.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
I can't drink coffee.
I don't know what's happening.
He is amusing himself by playing video games.
I can't be killed so easily.
I'm not your brother.
Were you even tempted?
Tom had many friends.
The sun is shining brightly.
You'd better hand that over.
She persuaded him to do it.
He is not kind to her.
I want to see if he really fixed this.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
Have you told everyone when and where the meeting will be?
He was late to his own wedding.
Have you ever broken a bone?
Are you paying together or separately?
Don't be alarmed.
This is a new kind of melon.
Everyone is going to call me a liar.
He disappeared into the crowd.
We had little water.
Are you a member of this crew?
In 1683, the Turks besieged Vienna for the second time.
Are you quite certain about it?
Stop playing hard to get.
I don't know which of you is crazier.
I will deal with them myself.
I don't trust you at all.
I'm above telling lies.
I know they'll all want to help you.
I owe two months' rent for my room.
Tom and Mary went outside.
You caught me off-guard.
Could you please lend me your dictionary?
Tom remembered everything.
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain.
No one disagreed.
The students applauded.
Give me a drink, please.
You're doing it wrong again.
They're just students.
Do you like robots?
You can't be too careful these days.
He lives in the western part of town.
What is this?
The sun was shining, yet it was cold.
Tom put the vase on the table.
I felt bad afterwards.
Come on everyone, let's dance!
I think your English has improved a lot.
Check this.
What's all this noise?
I did this for you.
We are all born mad.
We can't win.
Tom was excited, too.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
You're incredible.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
Please mail this letter on your next trip to the post office.
He stopped drinking.
How are you going to pay for this?
Did I fall asleep?
I had a great time.
Tom wants to move to Boston.
He has not come yet. Something may have happened to him.
I didn't think I needed any help.
All the students are studying English.
I really want you to quit.
Did it go well today?
Stop correcting me.
There is a path through the fields.
You don't have to apologize.
It's a nice day, isn't it?
I can't feel it.
Is this fish still alive?
The world is small.
I expect your help.
They were scattered in all directions.
Why don't we go out and get drunk?
It used to be that a girl could only marry if she had a dowry.
Wind the clock.
What do you want now?
This place is all right.
That time table gives the hours of arrival and departure.
Keep your eye on him.
Everyone's relieved.
Do you follow?
Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task.
It's possible that they'll go to the supermarket today.
I remember seeing this before.
The holidays are coming.
You said we'd never catch Tom.
How lucky can one guy be?
I'd rather die than leave.
Tourism generated many new jobs.
This is my wine.
I'd like a nonstop flight to New York.
May I ask you a favor?
If that happened, what would you do?
It seems those two are made for each other.
It was not until I had a baby myself that I knew what mother's love is.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.
I'm supposed to be the one helping you.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
How's Tom?
I wanted to go outside and get a breath of fresh air.
You're very nice.
You're very timid.
You don't have to come.
She had an early breakfast.
Choose whichever you like.
I have nothing else to wear.
Tom arrived first.
I remembered everybody.
The radio is a bit loud.
I just don't get modern sculpture.
The rent is very high.
The wind blew the umbrella out of her hand.
How did you know what I was thinking?
Tom waited, but nobody came.
I'm reading things like famous novels which have been rewritten in simplified French.
You will regret this.
They did not keep their word.
Take the wheel.
There is no answer to your question.
I think you're funny.
Are you sure you can handle this?
What if there's a leak?
The earth is a lot larger than the moon.
Are you going to warn Tom?
If you don't do your duty, people will look down on you.
That's fantastic.
I need to go home.
Can you explain your answer?
It would make a great Christmas present.
She turned pale when she heard that news.
He spent the evening reading.
I have never tried Chinese food.
Why not join us for lunch?
Stay sharp.
How do you plan to help me?
It's worth a try, right?
One hundred and fifty people entered the marathon race.
Did I ask you?
Consult a doctor.
Everything is now ready for you.
I think that he is right.
Could I get one more beer, please?
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
They're sunbathing around the pool.
I feel lonely when you're not here.
I wonder what to make for dinner.
I'll dream about you.
The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
The number of people suffering from heart disease is on the rise.
I'd better see what's going on.
I figured you'd enjoy this movie.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
I love watching movies that make me think.
His son's criminal activities caused him great pain.
Is he a friend of yours?
You'll catch a cold.
Do I have to study?
I'm a lawyer.
My heart's beating so fast!
You should quit smoking.
In a sense, you are right.
Why aren't you all laughing?
I help him.
Everything must be handled very carefully.
You can't blame me.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
Both boys and girls should take cooking class in school.
They pitched their tents on the beach.
Tom is too young to travel alone.
I ran out of gas.
You're charming.
I'd like to go home now.
You should make sure that you get there on time. Tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late.
You don't have to explain anything.
I'm not the only one who wants to go.
The writer is well known to us.
They've bet the farm on it.
Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
American kitchens are much bigger than Japanese ones.
Coffee, please, with cream and sugar.
Rabbits can swim.
Half of them are students.
My husband reads the newspaper while eating breakfast.
I wanted to help Tom understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
Who are you talking about?
I hear from my mother every month.
It's not my job to do that.
Your dress is already out of fashion.
He was kind enough to help me.
I had broken my glasses, so that I couldn't see the blackboard.
I hope something good happens before the day is over.
If your answer is correct, it follows that mine is wrong.
I knew that would interest you.
Are you looking for something?
Tom has been waiting for you to get here.
He took over his father's business.
You can't imagine what my life's been like since you've left.
Maybe we should start.
She is French.
I had forgotten that.
Japan's foreign aid is decreasing in part because of an economic slowdown at home.
Does he want to look at it?
He was surprised at the long-distance phone bill.
Some people think the president spends too much time traveling.
I want to know what you're doing here.
I speak a little Japanese.
They supplied the soldiers with enough food and water.
I was too ambitious.
How does your opinion differ from his?
It's about time.
You were there, weren't you?
I guess my mind just wandered.
That's fine with me.
I know your father.
It was awesome.
We can continue playing, as long as we don't make too much noise.
It happened very fast.
Don't do it.
Tom wants to buy a Japanese car.
He turned on the radio.
Everyone in the classroom was coughing.
His policies were too progressive.
Give me a hammer.
Tom's name is on the envelope.
I think it's the right thing to do.
Tom swims very fast.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
You don't seem to want to come with us.
This elevator is out of order. Please use the stairs.
I had a good time last night.
I'll pick you up at your home.
We don't need a visa to go to France.
Tom says he will never go there again.
He is a teacher.
They never did what they said they would do.
I have a client waiting in the waiting room.
I want you to get in your car.
I'm just getting back to basics.
Where is Tom's classroom?
He doesn't want you to lose a whole week.
I took Tom to the hospital.
I went camping with my family.
He caught me by the hand.
I wish you were here with me now.
Do you think I should write to Tom?
I gave you fair warning.
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
Why did he do such a thing?
I think you're in my seat.
Someone left you a message.
She died in a bike accident.
Why would that make a difference?
If you want my help, you'll have to ask for it.
Let's visit my grandpa this weekend.
It ain't like before, you know.
Did you have fun last night?
Does this medicine actually relieve pain?
She puts aside a lot of money.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
She apologized for her delay.
The door may be locked.
The train wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be.
We probably don't want to do that again.
The joke's on you.
They are not very different from anybody else.
We'll have to shovel the snow off the roof.
It is time to go to school.
The urban-renewal project is now well under way.
Do you really believe those stories?
Are cats smarter than dogs?
Tom has beautiful blue eyes.
I think that maybe you're right.
She's a real gossip.
I was very surprised to see students cleaning their classroom after school.
Stop that now.
Tom began fixing dinner.
How many kids do you have?
I suggest you get going.
Do we need to wait for her?
I don't enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around.
Stop shouting.
I ran into an old friend.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
We're coming.
You crossed the line.
Tom made an exception.
What do you do for a living?
I just want a little more time.
You should not give him up for lost.
I think we should call the police.
Do we have time for a cup of coffee?
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
You're very brave.
You should free those animals from the cage.
Tom died from tuberculosis.
My mother is well off.
I saw you in the park yesterday.
He left the office without saying a word to anyone.
Please don't tell anyone else.
The cost of living has gone up.
I never thought about it that way.
I almost feel sorry for you.
I need to talk to you about this.
He says he won't come.
The bus leaves every ten minutes.
I just want to be left alone for a while.
I am familiar with this subject.
I have done everything I was supposed to do.
I love you both.
I just had my final exam today.
I recommend caution.
You need a joystick.

I'm going to run a couple of errands. Wanna tag along?
Would you like to go shopping with me?
My sister came along on the shopping trip.
Hey, wait a minute, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Let me handle it.
I thought it'd be fun to surprise Tom.
They absolutely detest each other.
My robot's name is Multi.
I need friends.
The report turned out to be false.
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
Did you go out last night?
I get up early.
I never sleep more than six hours.
Who will look after your dog?
I want to do this as much as you do.
Don't hesitate to ask if you need help.
It's not worth the pain.
This is your fate.
Why do you laugh so hard at his jokes? They're not even funny.
Those are my CDs.
I lost track of the time.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
I liked them before they were popular.
We're reading.
I can give it a try.
Here's the map that you were looking for.
What do you remember?
We just have to get out of here.
I like my life right now.

The same is true of all human beings.
Why don't you sing something for me?
She usually gets up early.
Could you write it down, please?
You don't know how much I wanted to do that.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
This is your hat, isn't it?
You need to decide what kind of person you want to be.
Tom, I'm happy for you.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
Hurry up, or we'll be late.
I thought you had learned that by now.
Her cheeks were red.
Do you like that?
You don't talk a lot.
She tried to comfort him, but he kept crying.
Throw it to Tom.
I want to go to sleep soon because I need to get up early tomorrow.
Tom was pardoned by the governor.
What if somebody sees you?
If you see Tom, please tell him for me.
Tom's father is in jail.
We waited outside.
Tom explained why he was there.
The allegations they made were unfounded.
What a beautiful garden!
I had some help painting the fence.
Is he really coming?
How much does that cost?
Chinese calligraphy is considered an art form.
Please be seated, ladies and gentlemen.
She looks very young.
People say that life is short.
I was really surprised.
She seems to have a tendency to exaggerate things.
I am not accustomed to walking long distances.
Are we done here?
He avenged his dead father.
Will that be for here or to go?
He has a lot of acquaintances.

Lie on the bench for a while with your eyes closed.
I can't take it any longer.
You're obviously in great shape.
I'd do this again if I had the chance to.
Let's discuss that problem later.
Have you tried it before?
It is not as good as it looks.
You aren't my mother.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
He is one of the greatest scientists in the world.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
I need to write that down.
How far is it from here to the hotel?
I hate you both.
Are you a high school student?
I already did that.
Come with me.
He has some money in the bank.
Tom is capable of anything.
The leaves of the tree turned yellow.
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
Tom didn't know anyone.
I realized what was happening.
Something's wrong.
We're not your enemy.
This is a sign.
I don't have any camping equipement.
I have a lot of things to do.
Don't forget to take out the garbage.
His aunt takes care of his dog during the day.
Tom is going to beat you.
You almost died.
Don't say such things.
I'd say you're jealous.
I go for a walk every day, except when it rains.
Come on, talk to me.
He had a talent for painting.
Let's take your temperature first.
I'd be delighted if you'd come with me.
The leaves of the trees have turned red.
I didn't think I'd meet you here.

She read the poem out loud.

I'll lend you any book that I have, as long as you keep it clean.
Our fence is made of iron.
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today.
Everything is connected.
Do you really think you can do that?
Are you accusing me of cheating?
We all have changed.
Does he live near here?
Cut the bell peppers into two-inch strips.
Why did you lock the door?
I don't have time to say this twice, so listen carefully.
Don't say too much.
Can we help?
She closed her eyes.
Thank you for the pleasant evening.
Maybe she is coming.
That's why I'm here today.
Did you turn off the gas?
Aren't you dressed yet?
I think you've done enough.
It was sweet of you to do this for us.
He has a friendly nature.
Since I've been on this diet, my weight is down, my cholesterol is down and my sleep apnea has completely disappeared.
What's your favorite subject?
They said it's OK.
My opinion is the same as yours.
He never travels without taking an alarm clock with him.
He isn't as energetic as he once was.
I can recommend this restaurant.
Have you asked if they want one?
The police are questioning witnesses.
Tell me what Tom said.
I had a little help from a friend.
When did you finish it?
I missed the bus by three minutes.
I eat fruit.
Fire is always dangerous.
Could you please briefly introduce yourself?
I didn't need to stay.
Don't act surprised.
Be there tonight.
I feel like I've been cheated.
Tom ignored our advice.
Have you ever traveled in a plane?
I can do it.
My father is interested in ancient history.
I know you probably want to be alone, so I'll leave.
It was very nice seeing you again.
It's not possible to live on that island.
Tom isn't easy to say no to.
When did you begin studying English?
You want me to help you, don't you?
I'm dependable.
What's your speciality?
You don't have to tell me this.
The truth is I told a lie.
The storm destroyed the whole town.
Think carefully before answering.
You can't fix it in the amount of time you have left.
I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never came.
I think maybe you've made a mistake.
I'm not going to see you again.
I'm extremely disappointed by the quality of the service.
Mary and I became good friends.
They're just for you.
Tom said that Mary seldom does that.
When the last customer leaves, we close the doors.
Shouldn't you be studying?
It was his silence that made her angry.
Are you happy in your house?
He lives in a cozy little house.
There's a snag.

I work at the embassy.
How much did you get out of the deal?
The enemy attacked us at night.
She opened the letter quickly.
I play in a band.
I was very hungry.
Isn't that better?
Call me when you can.
You must teach me what you know.
Please wait here for a while.
Did you forget something?
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
No matter how hard the training was, she never cried.
I was kidnapped.
That's where I can't agree with you.
I saw you yesterday.
Everybody started to leave.
That kid's a chip off the old block.
This dog is white.
He doesn't mean to be mean. It's just his nature.
Have you decided already?
I think you know that's impossible.
He narrowly escaped being killed.
Please be honest.
We will reach London before dark.
You're not that smart.
I've never been so embarrassed.
He walked through the forest.
We have no school today.
I made a few changes.
He was sick, so he couldn't attend the party.
Does this look good on me?
The evidence convinced us of his innocence.
Tom betrayed us.
I always tell the truth.
I got left behind.
I will deal with them myself.
She picked flowers.
Tom is irresponsible.
We've had a very hard winter.
What's going to happen that's so terrible?
I'm creative.
When did you find out?
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?
You shouldn't eat raw snails.
Who's the photographer?
He got his dander up.
How long did it take you to write this report?
I don't want to sing.
We're in pain.
She decided on a blue dress.
I just want you to be OK.
We're not going.
I will wait for a week.
I'm not your enemy.
Are those explosives?
He invested his money in stocks.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
When should I come again?
Please turn on the light.
Who's screaming?
I have to find her.
I hope you'll both be happy together.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
Mary's husband abused her.
I persuaded the policeman not to shoot the monkey.
She managed to scare off her attacker by screaming loudly.
She speaks Hebrew with her mother and Polish with her father.
I figured I might find you here.
My father is in his room.
I like music, especially classical music.
When I don't have anything to say, I am not embarrassed to be quiet.
That will cost you a lot of money.
I wish I'd met her.
I'm sad without you.
I could not refuse.
I guess I'd better start packing.
What if they don't like me?
See what happens when you give people advice?
It's a very simple process.
People can easily tell the difference between them.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
I'm the youngest in the family.
I thought I heard you.
I can't tell you the truth.
That's exactly what I did.
Do you think we should abandon ship?
She surprised him with a kiss.
You're a true friend.
You need to go.
They can't do this.
I'm not bragging.
I want an hourly update about what's happening.
I would ask him if I were you.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
As it is, I can do nothing.
He scraped the mud off his boots.
I'm asking you as a friend.
Probably you are allergic to pollen or dust.
He tried in vain to open the locked door.
Tom doesn't understand because he wasn't paying attention.
What a phony!
Never choose a vocation just because it looks easy.
I've got a bad case of jet lag.
I thought we could use the cloth napkins.
She sang with a beautiful voice.
I wash my hands before eating lunch.
This museum has been closed for five years.
It may rain this afternoon.
I saw you yesterday.
I never stay anywhere long enough to make friends.
You can do whatever you want to.
He has come a long way.
I'd like to reserve a single room.
I don't know why they do it.
We're out of time.
The reason is clear.
Can you imagine what life will be like for them now?
I don't see anything strange.
Help me out here.
Who are you there with?
When did you become a teacher?
Does someone here know how to do this?
It's not clear when he came here.
Where is the Greek embassy?
I'm psychic.
I have heard quite a lot about you.
All of them will get a prize.
I'd be depressed if that happened again.
Sorry, we're full today.
My car is parked in the alley.
I think it's strange that he didn't speak to you.
Do your parents speak French?
He shrugged his shoulders.
She's been practicing piano for a year and can play the piano somewhat.
I don't particularly like her.
I think we need more time.
Please take off your shoes.
He shook his son by the shoulder.
He died yesterday.
Please be careful.

The explorers finally reached their goal.
He can talk to spirits.
This isn't your fault, Tom.
They don't like to do that.
Who was this picture painted by?
The cat scared me.
How did he come here?
It's really awesome.
He went out the window.
I didn't read that.
I want you to do it at once.
A little reflection will show you that you are wrong.
His sudden death was a tragedy.
We are going to visit our aunt next Sunday.
You're unfair.
I tricked you.
They're right, of course.
Tom didn't have shoes on.
This mountain is difficult to climb.
The neighbors called the police.
I hate to bother you, but would you mind closing the door?
Did you talk about me?
I got a message that you wanted to see me.
Can you show it to me?
You would make a good diplomat.
Are you saying no?
I met him about noon.
He has a car.
Is sugar cane a fruit?
It is sad that so few people give money to help the hungry.
The only thing that really matters is whether or not you are happy.
He says that he has no memory of the evening.
She stood there even after the train was out of sight.
Without your help, I would have failed.
Tom wouldn't let Mary keep it.
I'll keep your secret.
I'll turn the power on.
What did she actually say?
What do you do on Sunday?
Have you called an ambulance yet?
One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead.
They'll all be here tonight.
Have a good time.
Please give him a call.
I'm a Windows person.
Where are we going tonight?
He persuaded his wife not to divorce him.
Come along with us if you like.
She was busy.
How did you reach such an interesting conclusion?
The window was open.
You are doing very well. Keep it up.
Wait here.
I can't forgive him for behaving like that.
Mary's parents hate Tom.
I really want a motorcycle.
We could watch a movie.
I thought you might like some company.
I'm a farmer.
Do your homework right away.
The landlord changed the locks.
Airplanes enable people to travel great distances rapidly.
By the time he retires, my father will have worked for almost thirty years.
Are you sure you don't want to go with us?
I've got so much left to do.
Some flowers bloom in the spring and other flowers bloom in the fall.
I've never told anyone.
I'm reading the New York Times.
I don't understand what's happening.
I don't deserve your friendship.
It's awesome.
Go and sit by your father.
I really miss you.
Classes begin at 8 o'clock.
I'm afraid of flying.
You may now kiss the bride.
He doesn't have any real friends.
If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay at home.
I didn't buy them.
Have you read the leading article in today's paper?
Hackers were able to break into the company's computer system and undermine its network security.
There is a very old temple in the town.
She turned down his invitation.
We lost.
I don't know why the meeting was postponed.
I didn't know that you used to work here.
They all laughed at their error.
Stop playing hard to get.
Look what I did.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
She was fully clothed.
Didn't you hear the bell?
If you don't know, who does?
He went to the library.
The problem is that my son doesn't want to go to school.
He chose them at random.
After spending hours out in the cold winter wind, my skin got all chapped and dry.
I love this store.
Doesn't that smell good?
It's no use pretending that you can't speak French.
It's not sure it will happen.
Have you called the boss already?
I thought you were older than me.
I don't care for him.
First, you must protect yourself.
The cops are here.
I don't dare tell him such a thing.
He asked that we be silent.
I'm not tired yet.
He will be playing tennis tomorrow afternoon.
What's the fax number for this hotel?
I don't know what you want me to say.
Are you envious?
Don't let me down like you did the other day.
He was deprived of his civil rights.
You've underestimated Tom.
What do you like to do in your free time?
She turned pale at the news.
I really have to be going now.
He robbed me blind.
I heard you whistling. You must be happy.
Is this love?
Come off it!
Are you listening to the radio?
I saw a beautiful bird.
Are you seriously ill?
I'm going to fly to the moon.
We've only got three more days.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
Whales are classified as mammals.
He says that he enjoyed it very much.
You're very busy.
I think that Tom will tell you the truth.
I know it myself.
Is Tom alive?
Tom caught Mary stealing his money from the cash register.
"What should I do?" I said to myself.
The boy is wearing glasses.
Tom spent a week in Boston.
We haven't been invited yet.
I am glad to help you.
Red is better.
Sit down, Tom.
What did you do to my phone?
I'd like to reserve a table for two.
Come outside.
What if someone sees this?
We had no drinking water.
I did it out of curiosity.
I'll leave it up to you.
I believe you'll get over it soon.
Do you want to play with Tom?
You've gotta be kidding!
Why didn't you call somebody?
Disconnect the plug.
I'd like to go to France.
She ordered a cup of tea.
They're talking.
Be fair.
They don't despise you.
Don't be so childish.
She's too old for you.
Where was your father?
I'm studying French.
I'm not ready to do that.
We did it ourselves.
Why don't we just sit here and talk?
I did it without consulting anyone.
You shouldn't get near my dog while he's eating.
I'm doing it myself.
I'm pretty sure that it won't snow today.
I won!
I don't feel like partying.
You should have told me a long time ago.
I bought a few eggs and a little milk.
Watch how I do it.
I've decided not to swim this afternoon.
What time shall I pick you up?
Did Tom ask you to do it?
They're dead.
It is no use arguing with him about it.
I doubt Tom knows Mary.
I know you're on vacation.
He works at night.
I just emailed you.
How long were you at the party?
Tom and Mary aren't coming.
You've got to take care of yourself.
I liked working with you.
Let's just say no.
Don't push it.
Is it all wrong?
She attributed her success to good luck.
At first, they were all convinced he was innocent.
I completely forgot it.
Are you kids hungry?
They didn't see anything.
Get me another lawyer.
Your house is very nice.
This made me sad.
Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan.
I'm feeling fine now.
Did I wake you?
He made mistake after mistake.
He likes to talk of love.
I wanted the best.
I'm a dog trainer.
Tom is head over heels in love with Mary.
There were soldiers on these ships.
I felt like I was intruding.
It's only effective at close range.
Do you enjoy studying?
I hate my roommate.
One of my friends knows you.
How come the sky is blue?
His manners aren't those of a gentleman.
I think it's time we made some changes.
He is going to run for mayor.
You'll get into trouble if your parents find out.
Tom is old school.
I, too, have a question.
How do you know what I had?
I do like you.
They don't speak Spanish.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
I have an important meeting.
You gave me your word that you would look after them.
Scream as loud as you can.
He tried to put the blame on me.
Was anyone arrested?
She asked me if anything was the matter.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
You have to be patient.
He is unmarried and has no brothers or sisters.
It will be entertaining, if nothing else.
Jump as high as you can.
Please send me a picture of yourself.
No one can help you, Tom.
Are you still jealous?
We can't do everything.
Never be this late again.
Tom only eats fruit.
He never asked me.
Take off your cap.
He always talks as though he were addressing a public meeting.
This is all that I know about him.
They'll try again.
You did something incredibly stupid.
Tom, someone is here to see you.
I want your answer by the end of the day.
Why are you always whining?
I am going to buy a new car.
I am accustomed to living alone.
Tom had to do some work.
He is completely absorbed in his business.
This proverb is worth remembering.
She has had quite a lot to drink.
It was nice meeting you here.
It was difficult to remove the coffee stain.
Take a look at this report.
It was dark in the room.
I don't know whether he will come or not.
What do you say you join me for dinner?
She is always buying expensive clothes.
You're a terrible dancer.
The street was bustling with shoppers.
They all deserve to die.
Dogs are loyal animals.
Tom walks quickly.
Tom showed Mary his stamp collection.
Who is that man?
I'm sure everything will work out just fine.
She promised not to go out alone.
How was your trip to Boston?
You've still got all your life in front of you.
Stop avoiding the question.
I have lots of things to do.
Your face is red.
I've made a list of things I'd like to buy.
Do you know why she's so angry?
Do not say such foolish things.
I'm really not hungry.
I want to do it myself.
I don't have time to say this twice, so listen carefully.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
They're too dangerous.
Tom refused to tell us anything.
She lived in the suburbs of Tokyo when she was young.
Tom would never agree to that.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
You can call me anytime you like.
Two families live in the house.
You're being silly.
Careless driving causes accidents.
Do you know what color she likes?
Dogs wag their tails and cats swish theirs.
Tom is playing.
Tom certainly goes to bed early.
You don't fall in love with somebody because he's perfect.
I got what you wanted.
Stop dreaming.
Do you eat rice in your country?
I'd rather be here than in Boston.
You get used to it.
I know what they're paying you.
I will have finished the work before you return.
The room is hot.
It was a victory for the whole country when he finished first in the race.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
Let's reconsider the problem.
I like swimming very much.
It seems that you're not having fun in here.
I'm still intimidated by you.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
I thought you'd be dead by now.
You're going to ruin your eyes.
Hold the line, please.
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
This may be research my secretary did.
You're fortunate.
I walk to school every day.
What's your first name?
We will be living in England.
Are you through with the paper?
Doesn't anything ever get to you?
Tom left his umbrella in the classroom.
Let's ask the teacher.
Tom never used to eat so much junk food.
Your cat is driving me crazy.
Well, I'm proud of you.
You will soon come to like this town.
You don't really expect me to tell you, do you?
We grow wheat here.
Tom is back in his apartment.
Who listens to Tom?
It's an incredible sight.
She has a flower in her hand.
When she heard the news, she broke down crying.
She did it carefully.
Did I mess up again?
I didn't think it would be that much.
I sat down next to him.
Who vanished?
I want my hammer back.
We mean you no harm.
How can you make your way in life without a good education?
I have a schedule to keep.
What're you doing with my car?
Tom doesn't know how to drive a manual.
You have overstepped your authority.
She is fluent in English and French.
He never seems to grow older.
Be there tonight.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
You're one savvy negotiator.
Where do you want to go tomorrow?
I wasn't hired.
I thought you'd be happy.
I am loved by my mother.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
I made no promises.
You're such a liar.
Some Canadian territories have almost no people.
Why not talk to her about it directly?
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
I will not be able to open the box without breaking it.
How would you describe yourself?
Did you hear what I said?
Tom is cruel.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
I need to know.
Let's do something different this afternoon.
My room has three windows.
I will never forgive you.
I guess that's good for you.
You're a very attractive woman.
I'm just a tourist.
I am loved by my mother.
He is not rich, but he is happy.
The pain was agonizing.
Give Tom a second chance.
Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
You don't seem so smart.
I will devote my life to the study of history.
There are six people including him.
The doctor wouldn't allow me to take part in the marathon.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Can't you help us?
Don't cry over spilt milk.
Whatever you do, don't push this button.
You'll understand it right away.
I don't believe in banks.
I will go even if it rains tomorrow.
It's extremely ugly.
At last, we reached the summit.
I can't believe I actually said that.
You should protect your eyes from direct sunlight.
I want you to tell me what to do.
I just think we need to be extra careful.
She found him a seat.
Can I get you something to wet your whistle?
Tom gave his all, but it wasn't enough.
The rebels sabotaged the railroad.
I was totally dumbfounded.
I can tell you're a nice guy.
I don't think this is a good idea.
Your parents are expecting your call.
I thought you'd want to see this.
Why did you back away?
I'm begging you. Don't make me laugh. I did too many sit-ups yesterday and my stomach muscles hurt.
He is handsome and clever.
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
I am not good at mathematics.
These trees are beautiful.
You've got to be kidding me!
Have you ever seen her?
I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
He went to bed early.
I don't recommend eating in that restaurant. The food is awful.
It is Pochi's food.
I saw him wash the car.
Mathematics is her weak point.
I plan to do it soon.
All this is for my personal use.
She has a son everybody loves.
Tom didn't help me.
She sat next to him and listened quietly.
The bear is quite tame and doesn't bite.
Tom adopted Mary's three children.
Where's the car?
How many do you see now?
Just say yes.
I've always wanted to try it.
You're not allowed to eat those.
Are you still upset about what happened?
You're sleepy.
Do you want to hear my theory?
Stop whimpering.
I'm not thinking about it.
The goods arrived undamaged.
I hate to interrupt, but I need to say something.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
You were absent from school yesterday.
It was excruciating.
A sleeping child is like an angel.
I want to talk to your superior.
Who is your favorite player?
I'm not talking to you.
Give me my drink.
I'm not really asleep, just dozing.
Give him a hug.
Tom tried to leave.
I'm sleepy!
Don't you do this to me.
Have you ever dyed your hair?
I didn't know you were awake.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
Let's stick with the plan.
Are you sure you can handle this?
She forced him to sit down.
"Let's go to the movies next time." "What makes you think there will be a next time?"
You're the leader.
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus.
Do you know what time that supermarket closes?
I saw you.
Tom was scared to death.
He found a good place for me.
I'm not from here.
I don't think I could ever do this again.
He was a good friend.
Can you wait a little while?
Stir the paint with a stick.
I'm playing a TV game.
Who do you think the murderer is?
We enjoyed ourselves at the party.
She asked him how to get to the station.
You don't deserve to live.
You can take part in the meeting regardless of your age.
We should do better.
I'm not sure I want that.
Tell me your story. I am all ears.
Can you drive a five speed?
I went aboard.
What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
What is the reason for that lie?
They were soldiers.
I thought it might be you.
You're a wonderful friend.
The meeting hasn't started yet.
What happened to that friend of yours that you introduced me to last weekend?
Be careful not to drink too much.
You must read this book.
I lost my favorite pen.
It was cold, so we lit a fire.
Do you have something to say to me?
I was in a better mood three hours ago.
The loud drill gave her husband a headache.
The rooms in this hotel are pretty basic.
It doesn't work so well because the battery is low.
Are you ambitious?
You're going to have to stop doing that.
The results were spectacular.
They're not home yet.
Do you think I could do that?
What do you advise me to do?
Tom has never asked me for money.
It's all over between us.
The money should be distributed to those in need.
I ate bread and butter this morning.
Are you coming in or not?
Did you have a good time yesterday?
He visited Japan while he was President.
I think this is mine.
Go back to sleep.
We'll have little snow this winter.
I was happy there.
It wasn't very fun.
I guess you heard about what happened this morning.
I know everything.
I no longer have the energy to talk.
How dare you hurt people this way!
If that doesn't work, try something else.
Don't make me stay.
I made that one.
I know what you could've done.
I approve of your plan.
There's no need to go to school today.
I won't tell anybody.
I haven't found Tom yet.
He is a member in good standing.
You need to reboot your computer.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
Her coat is fur on the inside.
Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood.
We know how important this is.
I have a sweet tooth.
I have had to stay in bed for two days.
We only have three bicycles.
How are you going?
Tom walked across the room and opened the window.
Please say hello to your family.
This is a great theory.
I know him better than anybody.
Do you think I should go alone?
How can I deactivate my account on this site?
She asked me what had become of him.
I want these.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
We're almost ready.
That's one of them.
Do you believe me now?
Welcome back.
Can anyone drive?
The soldiers had more powerful weapons.
I strongly advise you to use this.
Tom paused to catch his breath.
Is the wound very deep?
I hope our luck doesn't run out.
He has some experience in teaching English.
How do you talk to women?
If Tom wants to leave, he can.
I don't care about politics.
This road follows the shoreline for the next thirty kilometers.
I'm not making it up.
Make a wish.
I still don't know what I'm going to say.
That was last week.
Water expands with heat.
Tom wanted Mary to wait for him at the library.
Tom shouldn't have done what he did.
I've already made it.
You look tired.
Bad weather prevented us from departing.
I didn't realize you were awake.
Do you want another one of these?
I'm asking you to tell me how you feel.
Let me see what it looks like.
It tastes just right.
Don't you want to see the world?
Tom is an architect, right?
Ice skating can be graceful and beautiful.
Blondes earn 7% more than women with any other hair color.
He is a bit of a coward.
I am very tall.
He has a good memory.
I had two cups of coffee.
Why are you waiting?
You should check your blood pressure.
You never arrive on time.
I can't really put a price on that.
We heard something moving in the next room.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
He must not live.
You look terrific.
I was really shocked.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
What should I do next?
We're taking over.
You've got a fever.
All our plans went wrong.
They accused me of being a liar.
Would you like some help?
A man's worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is.
A well-made cup of coffee should require no cream or sugar.
I won't be here that long.
I caught a bad cold last week.
Whatever you do, don't drop your new phone.
A stewardess was rescued from the wreck.
There is no point in pretending to be sick.
Something was wrong.
The job is almost finished.
Nobody's found a solution yet, have they?
Please leave your message on my answering machine.
She always says no.
He devoted his life to his study.
He stood at the end of the line.
I waited for him all day long.
I am afraid of what the teacher will say.
I paid about 50 bucks.
I thought you might like some hot coffee.
She witnessed him being killed.
I wish I could take back what I said.
The cost of living increased dramatically.
Please follow the school rules.
Tom plays organ at our church.
What teams were playing?
I drive a hybrid.
I need to find Tom now.
I apologize to all of you.
I'm afraid he cannot come.
Shouldn't you be studying?
I don't have your strength.
I really liked that.
I didn't want to spend any more time working on that project.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom heard a noise and went outside to see what it was.
I was absolutely right.
All men are created equal.
Tom really should've given Mary more time.
Tom felt very tired.
I couldn't see Tom's face.
You should listen to his advice.
I would like to go to the USA.
I wish I had more friends.
She failed every time she tried.
Please let me know when you come to Osaka.
He was very scared when he saw this big snake.
What do you think of it?
I will come, weather permitting.
I can't remember it.
Write down your date of birth here.
Can I help you?
This is no longer funny.
The house is said to be haunted.
Be sure to look over your paper again before you hand it in.
"Thank you, I'd love to have another piece of cake," said the shy young man.
Stop harassing me.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
You don't sound entirely convinced.
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
What makes you think we have a secret?
Didn't I ask you not to dance with Tom?
I let them go.
Tom took a step backwards.
I had a sharp pain in my chest yesterday.
I don't intend to help Tom do anything.
I feel ashamed.
It's not supposed to be fun.
Can I see that again?
They were forced to withdraw.
I'm glad you're coming.
What do you want me to do?
Tom never breaks promises.
Start here.
What's the difference between asteroids and comets?
It wasn't Tom that Mary was angry with.
You can't just barge in here whenever you feel like it.
Do you think this is some kind of game?
Tell us what's going on.
Who's your French teacher?
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
Few passengers survived the catastrophe.
Tom and Mary studied together.
Our team lost.
If you don't have this key, you won't be able to get in.
Everyone likes her.
Tom will never change.
They said yes.
I glanced at my watch.
I have to borrow some money.
Cats catch mice.
My GPS works very well.
It happened a long time ago.
How about running?
Who did you learn it from?
I don't understand this sentence.
I have to dress up.
I built this for you.
They finished their meal.
I get on very well with your cousin.
He's a very nice boy.
I have someone I want you to meet.
We should obey our parents.
I don't know how long it'll take.
We're not happy.
I've gone to Kyoto twice.
I figured I'd find you here.
It's like being in a candy shop.
We have plenty of time now.
We really can make this happen.
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
Tom deserves a promotion.
They abandoned the ship.
The movie was interesting.
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
May I escort you home?
Her pregnancy was fraught with complications.
Did you get fired from your last job?
Tom went with Mary to Boston.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
Watch the door.
Let's try to make our world better.
They all scoffed.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
Hurry up.
He has been dead for five years.
Christmas is only a few days away.
You need to lower your standards.
They agreed to start early.
That was the worst movie I've ever seen.
Would you like to see Tom?
I think you're right.
Mary can't have any more children.
I was in prison for three years.
Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
He stuck with his own theory.
They hid in the cellar.
I felt like my life was over.
She didn't want him to die.
We are looking forward to going on a hike next week.
I do not mince words.
I'd like you to do your best.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
Grab as much as you need.
Do you really want to go to the party with Tom?
Are you really that stupid?
Don't talk about yourself like that.
My father was about to leave when the telephone rang.
This is reality.
I never thought it'd be this hard to create an iPad app.
That was a good trip.
I don't plan to vote in the upcoming elections.
The ceiling is very low in this room.
Helen Keller was blind, deaf and dumb.
I was not feeling well.
It was time for lunch.
I don't need anybody's permission.
Nobody's going to blame you.
Don't you see what's going on?
More tractors meant fewer horses and mules.
I will start working on July first.
You can do it, too.
Who told you?
I've been following you.
We're not really sure.
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Are you a paleontologist?
How are your grades?
Feed the bird.
Don't you wish you lived here?
You're wasting ammo.
The way she talks gets on my nerves.
Buy a book and read it.
I guess I should have read it more carefully.
I refused to believe it.
I wanted you to have this.
I just don't know what to do anymore.
Christmas is December 25th.
I just didn't want to upset you.
Would you be friends with me?
Don't sound so surprised. You know I can do whatever I want to do.
I gave up on the idea of buying a house.
They're all bad.
Nature is full of mystery.
This room is for VIPs.
He listened to the music with his eyes closed.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
Isn't that right?
Why are you doing this?
There's nothing up here.
I felt great.
Thanks a bunch.
If only I could sing well.
Take a few days off.
It happened here.
I just want you to be safe.
Can you imagine the world without money?
All at once there was an explosion.
It must be done more carefully.
I'm one of you.
I must manage on a small income.
I lied about that.
That's the tricky part, isn't it?
I have a lot in common with him.
I can't get anyone to assist me.
This won't be hard.
Tom's injuries aren't considered life-threatening.
I shut the door behind me.
Medication and alcohol often don't mix.
What do you think Tom told Mary?
That movie stinks!
Tom gave Mary a box of chocolates.
There is no school today.
She couldn't convince him to give a speech.
I'm not ashamed to say that I cried.
You have the right to know.
Let's speak English.
Everybody in the building headed for the exits at the same time.
If I could be that guy instead of me.
This doesn't fit.
This flower is the most beautiful of all flowers.
Tom asked Mary who had given her the picture.
I promise you I'll come early.
Tom doesn't think that is a good idea.
I don't know if I'll be able to help you on Monday.
My wife stayed at home.
You had better go.
He broke the rules.
Do you understand what's going on?
What's your favorite pizza topping?
I'm by your side.
Let's go and investigate.
Weren't you here yesterday?
What could be the meaning of it?
He owes his success to good luck.
You won't have to take charge of that.
Is there a problem?
You're not yourself today.
Run for it!
This message doesn't make sense.
I let them go.
Do you work well under pressure?
You knew Tom better than I did.
Being an only child, he was the sole heir.
Glass is breakable.
Our house was built in 2013.
How about eating out this evening for a change?
I have a prior engagement.
Don't you see what you've become?
I hope that this isn't a mistake.
Tom scrubbed his feet.
How old were you when you did that?
I don't like him.
They're idiots.
Of us all, Tom was by far the best swimmer.
Everybody's happy.
A sin confessed is half forgiven.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
The machine stopped functioning.
You still haven't told me who he is.
It can't be that simple.
Please take note of that.
I feel like playing, too.
Tom has just finished washing dishes.
He's a widower with three small children to take care of.
Are you telling me that I can't go?
I'm beginning to see what you mean.
Everything has a price.
I tried.
We don't know where he is.
Are you on drugs or something?
Would you like to switch seats?
Don't forget us.
Why did you come early?
Stay awake.
I'll sign the petition.
He let the dog loose in the garden.
Everybody in the world desires peace.
He had the nerve to take my car without asking.
How's your wife?
We can't lose.
This is your wine.
My job is giving me a stomachache.
I went to the theater early to get a good seat.
The risk is too great.
I have less and less time for reading.
His sisters as well as he are now living in Kyoto.
I know exactly where I want to go.
All you have to do is try your best.
I know you're in love with me.
Tom smiled halfheartedly.
Let me see the pictures you took in Paris.
I did not expect it to be that big.
I felt very uneasy.
This is yours, isn't it?
The dog walked backward.
Oil and water won't blend with each other.
It was cheaper than I thought.
We headed for the mountain cottage.
Your questions were too direct.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
I don't go to school on Sunday.
That's what we've got to figure out.
You have beautiful lips.
What a funny man!
They made her go.
We're not going anywhere.
Stay down!
He read the poem in a monotone.
I hope we didn't wake you.
I ate lunch in the cafeteria.
She went to the hospital by taxi.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
She introduced me to her father.
I know you know this.
You don't need to come so early.
I know both of them.
What's your phone number?
I wonder where Tom learned how to do that.
I'm not done yet.
He continued the experiment.
The roses in the garden are blooming.
How did you get interested in art?
Someone has walked off with my pencil.
Will you sell me your house?
This factory produces 500 automobiles a day.
You should go home now.
Your bicycle is better than mine.
Why don't you understand?
This house is uninhabitable.
They kept drinking.
I want to buy another one.
Will you help them?
The party ended at nine.
I don't like those shoes.
She does know it.
What do you have to do?
What with good fortune, and his own effort, he won the first prize in the contest.
Tom didn't want to talk to anyone.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
All graduates are invited.
Are you about done?
I didn't try to kill anybody.
Please pass me the sugar.
I'm impressed with your French.
Why would I tell anyone?
He made an important discovery.
I'm not dying.
Don't rip me off!
I only buy fresh vegetables, never frozen.
This plan has no flaws.
The air is bad here. Will you open the window?
I met the prince himself.
I found the building.
Tom asked me if I had a plan.
You never listen. I might as well talk to the wall.
It was sort of fun.
Don't you have an air conditioner?
I won't be quiet.
Tom is an experienced teacher.
I realize that there's a problem.
Why didn't you just leave?
I'm coming to pick you up.
The police arrested the suspect.
The hotel was burned down.
I want you out of my life.
I said that I was confused.
I've got some problems.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
It's all right.
Don't look at me.
We don't even know if it's true.
He gave me a big hug.
Have you finished writing your composition?
It happened in Rome.
Catch me if you can.
I would rather throw the money away than give it to him.
I'm concerned with Tom's safety.
The parking lot in the back of the school is almost empty.
I am interested in swimming.
We have a lot of English books in the library.
We wear the same size.
You blew it, Tom.
Tom said he had a great time with you.
Why do people go to the movies?
Can you put the baby in the car seat?
We went to the café that I told you about.
The new museum is worth visiting.
She found her baby still asleep.
We are looking forward to seeing you soon.
I feel like I'm going mad.
Why don't you give me what I want to have?
As for me, I am satisfied.
I found your slippers under the bed.
He's aware of his own faults.
Tom corrected himself.
It is still unclear what caused the accident.
That's a coincidence.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary looks at him.
It's against my principles.
I just don't want to do it again.
I'm really proud of that.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
We made quite a team.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
Tom wanted Mary to tell him about her childhood.
We're going to stay until the end.
Do I annoy you?
What do you think about this plan?
I shouldn't drink.
You'd be amazed how many times I've told Tom not to do that.
The sky is getting brighter.
Sometimes I wonder whether or not there's a point to all of this.
Where is my newspaper?
I'm sure Tom is going to be hungry when he gets home.
I want to retire.
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
You know people.
Isn't that what we were supposed to do?
Don't share this with anyone.
Don't spoil your child.
You know the law.
Everything goes wrong when I leave.
What a beautiful sunset.
I haven't really made up my mind yet.
I don't want to be any more burden to my parents.
Tom listened with interest.
Be very careful.
He wrote a book on porcelain.
You shouldn't go around telling lies about people.
He is a student.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
You're not allowed to eat those.
I left my calculator on my desk.
He went to art school to study painting and sculpture.
When did you arrive in Boston?
It's time to eat.
Flashy people irritate him.
How long have you been living on Park Street?
I don't want to resign my job at present.
I go there every year.
The basket was full of apples.
The driver told us which bus we should take.
Will people make fun of me?
Tom is making tea.
Everyone agreed.
I'm staying here.
You are responsible for what you do.
Tom is worried sick about Mary.
Nothing is the matter with me.
I feel bad about the way things happened.
Baseball is said to have been invented in Cooperstown in 1839.
Tom is in a lot of trouble.
Everyone knows me.
I'm a little disappointed.
You didn't need to tell me that.
He took credit for my idea.
The young guy wants to drink.
They aren't the kind of people you should want to be friends with.
I'm OK with having just one friend.
I didn't factor those variables into the equation.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
What's that stain?
Buy me a drink.
Do you like mine?
Tom closed the door of his bedroom.
Are you all alone?
We finally have you where we want you.
There is a threat of a storm.
Come on, let's do it.
Having a small flashlight in your pocket may come in handy.
What are some foods you usually eat with a spoon?
You shouldn't go to school.
I wonder if she is married.
Tom says he's been fired three times.
I want to see him at all costs.
When do owls sleep?
Are you hiding something?
I was blinded by the light.
He's talking on the telephone.
You've been warned.
Listen carefully and do exactly what I tell you to do.
Don't be afraid of change.
I guess we'll never know.
Give my regards to your family.
I told her not to be late.
Stop worrying about it.
She disapproved of my trip to Vienna.
We missed the exit.
It went viral.
You have such a beautiful name.
In two years, the company has more than doubled in size.
She succeeded in getting what she wanted.
I think he has enough intelligence to understand it.
When ice melts, it becomes water.
You must study more.
The candle went out by itself.
Why do you interrupt me all the time?
A customs official asked me to open my suitcase.
You make it look easy.
The garden is separated from the road by a fence.
We looked for her.
Tom is a security guard at the airport.
She couldn't convince him to accept the bribe.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
You're very clever.
I went shopping in town today.
We eat more processed food than natural food.
We were just about to enter the room.
She is busy cooking dinner.
Rabies is the deadliest disease on earth.
I'm sure.
I'm sorry I'm such a big disappointment to you.
I visited Boston last month.
I only hope it is not too late.
The travelers stayed at a seaside hotel.
Tom told us that he had a headache.
I know you want to help.
They seem to be having fun.
I wanted you to do that.
We have a mutual friend.
I am from Shizuoka.
Explain it to me.
How can this be possible?
Let me get back to you.
She provided me with some food.
Both of them are hungry.
I like to dance.
I don't want you to leave.
I felt like I was intruding.
Can you do it faster?
Tom and I'll come together.
Did you just hit Tom?
I'm wet.
I like mysteries.
Tom could do with some help.
She was injured in a fall.
Jazz fusion is a combination of rock and jazz.
We should have left earlier.
Skating on the pond is dangerous.
I'll pay you.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'm not used to talking to people I don't know.
Tom and Mary quickly became friends.
The poor old man became so thin that now he's just skin and bones.
I can't do this job without you.
I enjoy being with you.
I sincerely hope things improve for you.
I suggested that we go fishing.
Our school library has many books.
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
I stayed at home all day instead of going to work.
What was I thinking?
We look up to him as our leader.
She is not tall.
He is introverted.
She is dieting.
It's locked.
Don't open the door for anybody.
Tell me what we're doing here.
Why don't you start by telling us how you feel?
I saw him running.
I know exactly how you feel.
We can rest after lunch.
The treatment is going successfully.
I don't know. Let me check.
Tom may know Mary's phone number.
This movie is a masterpiece.
This rose is beautiful.
Get on with it.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Why can't you be more like your brother?
Boys can be trained to behave.
She's better at it than I am.
That's very funny.
Everybody's tired.
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?
Some kids are playing in the park.
I was out all day.
Do you know what time that accident happened?
I want you to destroy all this.
I can't explain everything.
I asked Tom.
She is strong.
I know that's not true.
Just who are you?
Tom slipped and nearly fell.
I couldn't resist the temptation.
What are they whispering to each other?
My boss rejected the budget for the new project.
I know the reason, but I can't tell you.
Unexpected stuff happens all the time.
She admits knowing the secret.
Why do you feel that way?
She had a pleasant dream.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
You are always complaining.
I think you heard me.
What they did next was bad, even by my standards.
I'm going with Tom.
He feels very happy.
I like working with you.
Please stay where you are.
I went straight to bed.
She won first prize in the speech contest.
I take a bath every morning in the summer.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
He is at the head of the class.
What was the first concert you went to?
I know why you did it.
Tom was a drug addict.
They're outside.
He is always looking for praise.
The grenade blew up before the terrorist could throw it, and his arm was blown off!
The provisions ran out after a short time.
Who was there that night?
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
Now that we're alone, let's have fun.
I just wanted you to accept me.
I can't teach you anything else.
I didn't see him.
I had to go back.
It will not be long before he recovers from his illness.
I was one of the skeptics.
Is there something we can do?
Generally speaking, a woman will live longer than a man.
Tom wanted Mary to accept his gift.
I see you are ready.
The teacher got well again.
I'm still thinking about the riddle.
I'm not all that busy.
Would you like to go have a drink?
I like that shirt.
He was deaf, too.
I saved you.
How are you related?
Tom can play the piano well.
That didn't help us.
This job is kind of boring.
Be as specific as possible.
Did it ever occur to you that I might be busy this afternoon?
I can't make it to your party next weekend.
I'm a little bit busy.
Tom wanted to spend the rest of his life in America.
What do you do when you're not at work?
Tom likes his life.
She regarded me suspiciously.
I didn't know that he could speak English.
That girl has a lovely doll.
I'm a little confused.
I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
I hate paperwork.
He is nothing but a child.
The car is not illegally parked.
Tom's parents are both killers.
I'll vote for you.
Take a card.
I have tenure.
Are you ready?
How would you describe me?
She is the editor-in-chief.
A number of countries have strict laws against drugs.
Tom is much younger than you think he is.
He stiffed me for fifty bucks.
There were beautiful flowers on the reception desk.
What do you think of this plan?
We have a stressful day ahead of us.
Tom walks slowly.
You're the oldest.
I don't think I'd like you as a friend.
I didn't like my teacher.
There is a tinge of red in the eastern sky.
Would 9 o'clock be all right?
He should have the right to decide for himself.
I bought the same camera as you have.
At least it's not raining.
This is your community.
He ran the risk of having an accident.
Did you see what I did?
Was I snoring?
Did you see anybody else?
I can do this.
The sound of a gunshot echoed across the canyon.
You're lying, aren't you?
No matter how fast you drive, you will not get there on time.
We must leave right away.
I've never even told my husband.
You're very flexible.
Dance with me.
She used to wash her hair before going to school.
She advised him to go by bicycle.
I couldn't speak.
I want to know how you know that.
Aren't you embarrassed?
Will he ever change?
I am ready to follow you.
As soon as he returns, I will tell you.
I can't get her out of my mind.
Why didn't you come into work yesterday?
The dictionary is of great use to me.
Quit acting like a baby.
You may come in now.
We're practically brothers.
I think we need more coffee.
We had no drinking water.
I don't think you can sell that.
I don't think anyone noticed what we did.
I'm completely exhausted.
What did his wife say?
She is living in the middle of nowhere.
It is interesting that no one noticed that mistake.
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.
This is awful.
We reached the top of the mountain.
What do you think of Tom's new tattoo?
I can't put up with that loud noise.
I'm fit.
What's your favorite band?
Have you ever been to Africa?
I decorated my room.
You'll soon get used to speaking in public.
She advised him to take a rest.
It's very sticky.
Time's up.
Who talked?
You're part of this.
I'm sorry, today is fully booked.
When I woke up today, I yawned, stretched, rubbed the sleep out of my eyes, and put on a pair of slippers.
Tom offered Mary a slice of cake.
Where shall we go?
I like singing with Tom.
I have a car.
Go with Tom.
If you eat three square meals a day, your body will have the energy it needs.
If so, then there's no problem at all, is there?
They're free.
Do you see me?
I thought you'd be older.
I've asked you this question before.
We can't put a young boy in prison.
I just bought a new pair of shoes.
Tom went into the room first.
I hope the police catch whoever did this.
I really didn't have time.
Nobody can stop it.
That's very nice of you to say.
Tom never saw Mary.
It was shorter than she expected.
Where do you think Tom is?
You're not going to want to miss this.
No one I know writes letters anymore.
Tom doesn't want to lose Mary.
Bathe the baby, won't you?
She shot him.
What can I tell Tom?
American women didn't have the right to vote.
You have my mug.
Your handwriting is similar to mine.
Is this guy bothering you?
A teenager sometimes acts like a baby.
I just had something incredibly strange happen to me.
I thought you lived with your family.
I aim to be a doctor when I grow up.
He ran off with his best friend's wife and hasn't been heard from since.
The situation is grave.
Tom won't be successful.
You'd better go by bus.
I'll paint the house.
Is there space for one more person?
A well is a place where you can get water.
He is more lucky than clever.
Unfortunately, I can't come tomorrow; I have a meeting.
Tom kept the window closed.
His brother goes to school by bus.
You're very curious.
I hate seeing you like this.
There is an urgent need for better communication.
You said you were going to handle it.
We've already covered this subject.
I won't get caught.
No one told me that he had failed.
I want to see that movie again.
I will go when he comes back.
I get the idea.
Will six o'clock suit you?
Give me some coffee if there is any left.
Don't forget to call your parents.
It was a crime of passion.
Do you like Wagner?
It is completely natural for her to be mad.
I wish you good luck.
Keep focused on your work.
If you want to sell your old sofa, why not put an advertisement in the local paper?
I want the facts.
She's out shopping for shoes.
My father bought me a bicycle.
She was wearing an ugly dress.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
That's not my fault.
I forbid that.
Can you imagine what the 21st century will be like?
I thought this was mine.
Do you have a Twitter account?
I'm looking forward to that.
Who asked you to sing?
If you hear the alarm, walk, don't run.
Could you press this button?
You may take either the big box or the small one.
They couldn't find the problem.
Tom's not in the best of health.
I spend at least three hours a week studying French.
You know this isn't the way we should be doing this.
The people here are really friendly.
He must have left the water running.
These shoes are very comfortable.
A voyage to the moon in a spaceship is no longer a dream.
You guessed right.
I've come this far, so I'll keep going.
Please ask the secretary to stock the office supplies in the storage room.
Laughter is infectious.
Let go of me.
Don't you read the tabloids?
The boss gave us all a day off.
Do you have psychic powers?
They're keeping it under wraps.
Clear off the table.
Have you eaten yet?
Let's go this way.
Do you get it?
I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?
We watched the soccer game on TV.
I'll be back at six.
You said you were going to handle it.
I hate paperwork.
I had a light lunch.
I don't think you can sell that.
Please show it to me again.
Don't go to such a place at night.
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
The Germans are in favor of austerity.
His birthday just happens to be the same as mine.
Tom said that he had been cleaning the house all day.
The job offer still stands.
She introduced me to him at the party.
Do you want to come over tonight?
He is careful about his manners.
I like rice.
Can't you ever be punctual? I have been waiting here for one hour.
Everything hits the mark with him and he lets you know it.
I get a three percent commission on anything I sell.
Don't burst my bubble.
Keep away from me.
Can you explain why Tom isn't here?
I have been here since five o'clock.
Complaining won't change anything.
Are we alone in the universe?
I see why you don't want to go there.
Tom says he has an announcement to make.
Write down each word.
Ask at the police box over there.
Where did you stay?
We talked about it just yesterday.
My brother and I like the same food.
People don't say that anymore.
I want to thank you for all you've done.
The plane was about to take off.
I'm very busy this week.
May I go out for a walk?
Arabic is a very important language.
You should have telephoned in advance.
If I knew it, I would tell you.
Tom took care of the kids yesterday.
What are you doing in my office?
The Beatles gave five concerts in Tokyo in 1996.
He is giving me a hard time.
My mother baked a cake for my birthday.
Most girls think that they are pretty.
That's fun.
Good luck.
Do you sell sport shoes?
I never wanted to compete with you.
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Answer my question.
The people protested against the low altitude flight training.
This is just water.
I feel terrible about that.
How much is the annual membership fee?
Have you gone completely insane?
Do you need me to repeat the question?
Tom watched Mary dance.
It was a great privilege working with you.
Is it a deer?
We'll stay out of your way.
They're downstairs.
Let's hit the road.
Don't call anybody.
I didn't see the fire hydrant.
Are your parents home?
You're the oldest.
Can't you help us?
I'm attentive.
The more you study, the more you know.
If he really doesn't want to go, he shouldn't have to.
That's peculiar.
I don't have any problem getting to sleep.
Your answer is right.
It was a bitter pill to swallow.
You should go home now.
It leaves every thirty minutes.
Tom took Mary's money.
He felt sad because he lost his father.
Tom offered me a piece of cake.
He has a bookstore in the center of the city.
It isn't much of a car.
I thought you were hungry.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
You've got a vivid imagination!
You will soon get to like him.
Chew your food well.
I knew you'd come back to me.
You don't want to go to prison, do you?
If you do not have this program, you can download it now.
I don't approve of the way he bullies others.
Tom jumped out of the window.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
I want to go bowling with Tom.
I had a quick breakfast.
I'm going.
Owls are active at night.
That's clever.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
He is a big prankster.
Sorry, I don't understand.
We kept the children quiet.
He got the ball.
There's room for improvement.
I felt left out.
I had never seen him before.
What's in this bag?
You're very attractive.
I want to be careful.
Nothing we have done today has gone according to plan.
A child is crying somewhere.
She gave him a big smile.
I think you must be tired.
Fill in the blanks.
I think you should sit down.
Let's act like we're foreigners.
He was raging mad.
Don't be so impatient.
Are you young?
I'll come home by six o'clock.
Do I look pale to you?
He moved back with his parents.
Sorry, something went wrong.
I was a shy child.
Let him go.
He is usually straightforward and sincere and thereby gains the confidence of those who meet him.
I just don't want to be reminded of it.
That's all I ever wanted.
Do you like rap?
Eating fish is good for your health.
I like folk songs.
I know how to handle this.
Why don't you stay a minute?
The train left two hours ago.
How can you know that?
Hooker was extremely pleased.
Spring is just around the corner.
You had better see the doctor.
I appreciate the sentiment.
A glass of water, please.
I no longer want that.
It is absurd trying to persuade him.
Tom has a lot of responsibilities.
I want to trust you.
He was invited.
Isn't that where we first met?
They revolted against the government.
Nobody told me you were here.
They are engaged in cancer research.
It was not easy for us to find his house.
Sometimes I hear voices.
You must exercise more care in writing English.
Give that book back to me.
That helps a bit.
I would like to visit you.
Is there a cat on the table?
Tom asked Mary's advice about the problem.
He found me a good job.
Tom jumped.
You don't look very well. Are you sick?
Not everything's about money.
May I be of further service?
Here's the key to your room.
The air is pure around here.
She gave an oral report to her boss.
Stop trying to cheer me up.
Could you drop me off at the library?
The police are after you.
That's really not necessary.
Have you seen my pen?
Stop playing hard to get.
You had better put on your crash helmet.
A rack of lamb makes a great meal.
It took exactly an hour.
I live in Kobe.
He was the first to help him.
I'll be ready in a second.
I'd better do something before the problem gets any worse.
You may as well leave such a decision to your daughter.
Will you join us for a swim?
I love him, but he loves someone else.
He has a scraggly beard and a bum leg.
Bad weather prevented them from sailing.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that all clear?
Of all the films I rented, this is the only one worth seeing.
I'm wet.
These chairs are different.
Here are your keys.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
I'd never hire Tom.
I am proud of being a doctor.
You can do it.
What time does your plane depart?
How's the weather there?
The prisoners were set free.
The population of Tokyo is greater than that of London.
Tom eats very quickly.
I know what you want to talk about.
Now drink up.
Let's go for a ride in my car.
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
Do you have any cough medicine?
How am I going to get home?
We're not going out.
I spent yesterday reading instead of going out.
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him.
He has been to England twice.
One of the people you were with is a friend of mine.
He is one of my old friends.
It seems like I'm going to have a hard day.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
I want to sleep for a while.
Money isn't everything.
Do you know Tom well enough to ask him to do this?
Take a look at this.
You're smarter than I ever was.
I'm quite serious.
Let me know as soon as he comes back.
I've already fed the baby.
I want everyone to bring their children.
We worked together.
He went to New York as soon as he got the letter.
He asked me questions similar to those asked by many others.
I really like China.
We're trying to have a serious discussion here.
Do you have any problems with that?
I can make the time to talk to you.
Tom wasn't the one who borrowed my car.
He was buried alive.
I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
He's my partner.
Tom is sincere, isn't he?
Give me a reason to stay.
Suddenly, it became noisy.
This dog is shaggy.
I don't want distractions.
I prefer to eat alone.
She was voted prom queen.
You have a point.
Let's take that chance.
Did you write that?
It didn't go very well.
It's OK to take a picture from outside.
I'm too short to reach the top shelf.
Flowers are growing in the meadow.
Movie making is an exciting job.
Nobody knows his name.
Is it happening?
She studies English.
Would you mind letting me see your passport?
Can it really be this bad?
Do you have to go now?
Please call before you come.
He watched the boys swimming.
I am willing to help you.
I'm looking for a sweater.
Do you know what he has done?
I have a large collection of stamps.
Let's take a look.
I'll make some coffee.
That's what I've been saying all along.
You have to acquire real skills, not just superficial knowledge.
Put the tables end to end.
Can you please tell me where the restaurant is?
I don't think it's a bad thing.
The prisoners were set free.
His poems are difficult to understand.
My brother would often stay up all night reading novels.
Your French is perfect.
I thought something was odd.
Tom would've liked you. It's too bad that you never met each other.
I'll lend you one if you like.
This place hasn't changed much.
I really think you should stop doing that.
You don't look like a millionaire.
